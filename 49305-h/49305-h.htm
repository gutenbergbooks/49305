<p class="ph2 mt4">PRINCESS NAPRAXINE.</p>
<h2 class="mt2 nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<p>A blue sea, some palms with their heads
bound up, some hedges of cactus and aloes;
some thickets of high rose-laurel, a long marble
terrace shining in the sun, huge groups of
geraniums not yet frost-bitten, a low white
house with green shutters and wooden balconies,
a châlet roof and a classical colonnade,
these all&mdash;together with some entangled shrubberies,
an orange orchard, and an olive wood&mdash;made
up a place which was known on the
French Riviera as La Jacquemerille.</p>

<p>What the name had meant originally nobody
knew or everybody had forgotten. What
La Jacquemerille had been in the beginning of
time&mdash;whether a woman, a plant, a saint, a
ship, a game, a shrine, or only a caprice&mdash;was
not known even to tradition; but La Jacque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>merille
the villa was called, as, before it, had
been the old windmill which had occupied the
site, ere steam and fashion, revolutionising the
seashores of Savoy, had caused the present
pretty nonsensical, half-rustic, half-classical
house to be erected on the tongue of land
which ran sharply out into the midst of the
blue waves, and commanded a sea view, west
and east, as far as the Cape of Antibes on the
one side and the Tête du Chien on the other.</p>

<p>It was one of the most coveted spots on
the whole seaboard of our modern Capua, and
brought a little fortune annually to its happy
possessor, a respectable vendor of hams, cheese,
and butter in the Cannebière at Marseilles,
who for the coming season had pocketed now,
from Prince Napraxine, the round little sum
of two thousand napoleons.</p>

<p>And the Princess Nadège Napraxine, who
had set her heart, or rather her fancy, upon
it, was sitting in a bamboo rocking-chair and
looking over the house front, and thinking that
decidedly she did not like it. It had been an
idiotcy to take it, just the sort of folly which
her delegate in the affair always committed.
They would have been a thousand times better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
off at the hotels in Nice; you had no kind of
trouble at an hotel, and you could always
have your own cooks if you insisted.</p>

<p>For three months it had been the reigning
desire of her life to have La Jacquemerille for
the winter; it had been let to an American
millionnaire, and the apparent impossibility of
getting it had naturally increased her anxiety.
The American millionnaire had suddenly decided
to go home; Jay Gould or Mr. Vanderbilt
had done something that had disturbed
his digestion, and La Jacquemerille, which she
had never seen, but had fallen in love with
from photographs, was granted to her wishes
for the modest sum of forty thousand francs.
She had travelled straight from the Krimea to
it without stopping, had arrived by night, and
now was looking at it for the first time in
broad daylight with a sentiment very near
akin to disgust. She did not find it the least
like the photographs.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is so horridly low!&rsquo; she exclaimed,
after a long and thoughtful examination of the
frontage, where an Ionic colonnade sheltered
itself under a châlet roof from the Bernese
Oberland. &lsquo;I am sure it will be most dread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>fully
cold. And just look at the architecture&mdash;every
style under heaven! Was there ever
such an extraordinary jumble?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If it be a jumble, my dear, it is very suitable
to our generation; and you are very lucky
if, when you buy a pig in a poke, you get
nothing worse than a jumble,&rsquo; said another
lady who was sitting opposite to her, with a
book held upside down and a litter of newspapers,
and who was known in society as Lady
Brancepeth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pig in a poke! what is he?&rsquo; said the
Princess Napraxine in her pretty English, which
she spoke with scarcely any foreign accent.
&lsquo;The house is shocking! It is the Parthenon
mixed up with a Gasthof. It is a nightmare;&mdash;and
so small! I don&rsquo;t believe there is room
for one quarter of the servants. And just look
at these palms with their heads tied up as if
they had neuralgia; and I am sure they may
well have it, standing still in that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bise</i>, day and
night. I think the whole place utterly odious.
I will tell the women to unpack nothing; I am
sure I shall not stay a night; an Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">villino</i>
with a shingle roof and Grindenwald balconies!
Can anything be so absurd?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose you will wait till the Prince
comes downstairs?&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth with
a little yawn.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; why? He can stay if
he likes. Oh, dear! there is a Cairene lattice
at that end and these other windows have been
copied from the Ca d&rsquo;Oro, and the roof is as
Swiss as if it were a cuckoo clock or a
St. Bernard dog. What is one to do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; suggested Lady Brancepeth. &lsquo;People
do not die of a Swiss roof unless it tumbles in.
The house is all wrong, no doubt, but it is picturesque;
a horrible word, you will say, but it
describes the place. It <em>is</em> picturesque.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wrong things usually are,&rsquo; said the Princess
Napraxine with a sigh, as she surveyed
the Greek peristyle, the Swiss shingles, and the
slender Ionic colonnade. &lsquo;Are all these oranges
good for one&rsquo;s complexion, I wonder? It is
like sitting in a bright yellow room. I don&rsquo;t
like bright yellow rooms. Who said that
granted wishes are self-sown curses? Whoever
did must have wished to hire La Jacquemerille,
and done it. Why do they tie up those palms?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To blanch the leaves for Holy Week.
Every blade of grass is turned into money on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
this poetic shore. If the gardens have been included
in your agreement you can untie them;
if not, you cannot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They will certainly be untied; as for
agreement&mdash;your brother took the place for us,
I daresay he blundered.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What were your instructions to him, may
I ask?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, instructions? I do not remember. I
sent him the photographs, and wrote under
them: &ldquo;Take me the house at any price.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Curt as Cæsar!&rsquo;</p>

<p>With a little yawn the Princess Napraxine
looked down the long shining sea-wall of
white marble, studded at intervals with vases
of white marble filled with aloes; beyond the
marble wall was the sea&mdash;blue, bright, quivering,
and full of shifting lights as diamonds are.
Then her gaze came inward, and returned to
the outline of the house which was so daring
and contradictory a jumble. The creepers
which covered it glowed red in the December
noon; its blue and white awnings were gay
and fresh; its vanes were gilded, and pointed
merrily to the south; a late rose was garlanding
the Cairene lattice; some woodlarks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
singing their pretty little roundelay on the
boughs of a carob tree; it was all bright, lively,
full of colour and of gaiety. Nevertheless, she
hardened her heart to it and condemned it
utterly, out of mere waywardness.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall go away after breakfast,&rsquo; she said,
as she looked. &lsquo;Platon can do as he likes.
I shall dine at Nice, and you will come with
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was sure that was what you would do,&rsquo;
said her friend; &lsquo;so was Ralph.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then I shall not do it,&rsquo; said Princess
Napraxine.</p>

<p>She rocked herself soothingly in her chair.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a dear little bird that is singing; it
cannot be a nightingale in December. The sea
looks very much like our Krimean one; and
what a lovely air it is. Like an English June
without the rain-clouds.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wait till Madame la Bise comes round.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Madame la Bise comes round the
corner everywhere. She is like ennui&mdash;ubiquitous.
You have her in England, only
you pretend she is good for your health, and
your Kingsley wrote an ode to her; the rest of
the world is not such a hypocrite.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Kingsley? He was <em>Tom Brown</em>, was he
not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are <em>Tom Brown</em>! Really, Wilkes, you
know nothing of your own literature.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I was never educated as you clever
Russians are,&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth, good-humouredly;
she was sometimes called Socrates,
and generally Wilkes by her intimates. She
was the ugly member of a singularly handsome
family, and the nickname had been given to
her in the schoolroom. But her ugliness was a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belle laideur</i>; her face was charming in its
own way; her eyes were brilliant, and her
figure was matchless. She was an earl&rsquo;s
daughter and an earl&rsquo;s wife, and when she put
on the Brancepeth diamonds and showed herself
at a State ball, if ugly she was magnificent,
even as, if intellectually ignorant, she was a
marvel of tact, humour, and discernment.</p>

<p>Her friend and hostess was as entirely unlike
her as an orchid is unlike an aloe. She was
exquisitely lovely, alike in face and form, and
as cultured as a hothouse flower. She was just
three-and-twenty years old, and was a woman
of the world to her finger tips. She was very
cosmopolitan, for though a Russian by birth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
marriage her mother had been French, one of
her grandmothers English, the other German,
and she had been educated by a crowd of
governesses of many different nationalities.
All her people, whether Russian, English,
French, or German, had been very great
people, with innumerable and unimpeachable
quarterings, for many generations, and to that
fact she owed her slender feet, her tiny ears,
and her general look of perfect distinction.
She had a transparent, colourless skin, like
the petals of a narcissus in its perfect <em>mat</em>
whiteness; she had oriental eyes of a blue-black,
which looked immensely large in her
delicate face, and which could have great
inquisitiveness, penetration, and sarcasm in
them, but were usually only lustrous and
languid; her mouth was most admirably
shaped, and her teeth deserved the trite
compliment of the old madrigals, for they were
like pearls; she had a very ethereal and
delicate appearance, but that delicacy of mould
sheathed nerves of steel as a silken scabbard
sheathes a damascene blade. She had an infinite
grace and an intricate alternation of vivacity and
languor which were irresistible. Men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
madly in love with her, which sometimes diverted
and sometimes bored her; many people
were rather afraid of her, and this pleased her
much more than anything. She had a capacity
for malice.</p>

<p>She now held a sunshade above her head
and surveyed the house, and tried to persuade
herself it was charming, as her friend had
been so sure she would find it detestable. She
had wished for the place with an intensity
that had almost disturbed her sleep for some
weeks, and now she had got it and she hated
it. But as they had expected her to do so she
was determined to conquer her hatred and to
find it much better than its photographs. The
task was not difficult, for La Jacquemerille, if
full of absurdities and incongruities, was decidedly
pretty.</p>

<p>As she swung herself on her rocking-chair
and began to see with the eyes of her mind a
hundred improvements which she would instantly
have effected whether the terms of the
contract allowed of it or not, she saw coming
within the range of her unassisted eyesight a
large and stately schooner, with canvas white
as snow bellying in the breeze. She drew on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
her long loose tan-coloured glove cheerfully,
and said aloud:</p>

<p>&lsquo;After all, it is better than an hotel. There
is no noise, and nobody to stare at one. I
daresay we shall get through three months
without cutting each other&rsquo;s throats.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Brancepeth turned and looked out to
sea, and saw the schooner, and smiled discreetly;
she said as discreetly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am so glad, dear, you won&rsquo;t fret yourself
too much about the place; after all, you
are not going to live in it for a lifetime; and
though, no doubt, it is utterly wrong, and
would give Oscar Wilde a sick headache, yet
one must confess it is pretty and suits the sunshine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The trees had been cut, so that openings
in their boughs allowed the sea to be seen
from any point of the terrace. Princess Nadine
from under her sunshade watched the stately
yacht draw nearer and nearer over the shining
path of the waters, and drop anchor some half
mile off the shore; then she saw a gig lowered,
with red-capped white-shirted sailors to man it,
and a figure which she recognised descended
over the schooner&rsquo;s side into the stern of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
boat, which thereupon left the vessel, and
was pulled straight towards La Jacquemerille.
Neither she nor Lady Brancepeth appeared to
notice it; they talked <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chiffons</i>, and read their
newspapers; but the long boat came nearer
and nearer, until the beat of the oars sounded
directly under the walls of La Jacquemerille,
and the rowers were too close at hand to be seen.
But the Princess Nadine heard the rattle of the
oars in the rowlocks, the shock of its keel
against the sea stairs below, which she could
not see for the tangle of pyracanthus and
mahonia and many another evergreen shrub,
covering the space between the terrace and the
shore; she heard a step that she knew very
well, the sound of which moved her to a
slight sense of anticipated amusement, and a
stronger sense of approaching weariness, and
she turned her head a little, with a gracious if
indifferent welcome in her eyes, as a man ran
up the stairs at the end of the terrace, and
came along the marble floor in the sunshine&mdash;a
young man, tall, fair, athletic, with
a high-bred look and handsome aquiline
features.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have had a very quick run, surely?&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
said the Princess Napraxine, stretching out her
tan glove.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, we did all we knew, and crammed
on every stitch we had,&rsquo; the new comer
answered, as he kissed the tips of the glove,
and murmured in a lower tone, &lsquo;Were you not
here?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he crossed over to where Lady
Brancepeth sat, and kissed her cheek with
a brother&rsquo;s indifference.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear Wilkes, are you all right?&rsquo; he said
as he took up a majolica stool and seated
himself between them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take that bamboo chair, Geraldine,&rsquo; asked
the Princess. &lsquo;That china stool does not suit
your long legs at all. How many hours really
have you been coming from Genoa? I am
fearfully angry with you, by the way; how
could you take this place?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because you told me,&rsquo; answered Lord
Geraldine, staring hard. &lsquo;What was the command?
Take it, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coûte que coûte</i>. Not an &ldquo;if&rdquo;;
not a &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo;; not a &ldquo;but.&rdquo; Wilkes, do
you not call that too cruel?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear Ralph,&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth,
&lsquo;any woman&rsquo;s instructions should always be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
construed so liberally that a margin is left for
her at the eleventh hour to change her mind.
But do not distress yourself. I do not think
Mme. Napraxine really dislikes the place.
It is only her way. When she has bought a
thing she always finds a flaw in it. It is
her habit to condemn everything. She is a
pessimist from sheer want of ever having had
real disappointment.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look at the house. It speaks for itself,&rsquo;
said the Princess, contemptuously. &lsquo;Why
did you not telegraph and say that it was a
patchwork of every known order of architecture?
I would have told you to break off
negotiations.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you had seen the photographs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Photographs! Would you know your
own mother from a photograph if you had not
been told beforehand whose it was?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am so sorry,&rsquo; murmured Geraldine, as
he turned round and gazed at the offending
building. &lsquo;It is a pretty place, surely? not
classical or severe, certainly; but cheery and
picturesque. I looked all over it conscientiously,
I give you my word, and it is really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in very good taste inside; much better than
one could have hoped for in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maison meublée</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, it is Wilkes, not I, who finds it so irretrievably
bad,&rsquo; said the Princess Napraxine,
with tranquil mendacity; &lsquo;but if it be too bad
one can always go to an hotel, only in an hotel
one can never sleep at night for the omnibuses,
and the banging of other people&rsquo;s luggage, and
if I do not sleep I can do nothing. Here I
should fancy it is perfectly quiet?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quiet as the grave, unless the sea is howling.
But Monte Carlo is just behind that cliff
there; with fast horses you can drive over in
twenty-six minutes&mdash;I timed it by my watch.
You can have a score of people to dinner every
evening if you like.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Princess raised her eyebrows with a
gesture signifying that this prospect was not one
of unmitigated happiness; and Lady Brancepeth,
alleging that the sun was rather too warm
for her north-country bones, went away into
the house, being of opinion that three was no
company; her brother drew his bamboo-chair
nearer his hostess, and took the tan glove with
the wrist it inclosed in a tender grasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;So you do not like the poor place? I am
truly grieved!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She drew her hand away so dexterously that
she left the loose empty glove in his fingers,
and he looked foolish.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; I thought of going away to-morrow,&rsquo;
she continued, without any regard to his dejection;
&lsquo;I do not like palms that have the toothache,
and marble pillars that have married
wooden balconies. But your sister, who always
opposes me, is so certain I shall go that it is
very probable I shall stop.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Admirable feminine logic! No doubt
the poor house is utterly wrong, though it has
been the desire of everybody on the Riviera
ever since it was built. I felt sure you would
have been more comfortable in a good hotel
at Nice, and if I had ventured to volunteer an
opinion, I should have said so. Wilkes is quite
right; you will be bored to death here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She is quite wrong; she does not like the
place herself,&rsquo; said Princess Napraxine, with decision,
while she took back her glove peremptorily.
&lsquo;I do&mdash;at least in a way. The oranges
look jaundiced, and the palms rheumatic, but
those are trifles. They do say it hailed yes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>terday,
and the water in the washing-basin in
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coupé lit</i> was frozen last night as we came
into Ventimiglia; but I saw a scorpion on the
wall this morning, and heard a mosquito, so I
am convinced it is the south of the poets, and
am prepared for any quantity of proper impressions,
only they are slow in coming to me;
it is so excessively like the Krimea, terrace and
all. Should not you go in and see if Platon
be awake?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am convinced he is asleep. It is not
quite one o&rsquo;clock, and you arrived in the
night, didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; but he will get up, because he will
want to be off to Monte Carlo. He will spend
his life there and send over expresses every
hour for fresh rouleaux. When he is near a
gaming-table he is so happy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Enviable faculty!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is my faculty too. But I try against it;
he doesn&rsquo;t. Men never try to resist anything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Geraldine murmured words to the effect
that his life was one long compulsory resistance,
and his eyes completed the uncomplete
sentences.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rsquo; said his hostess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
&lsquo;You know I do not like <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">madrigaux</i>; and an
Englishman always looks so clumsy when he is
making them. Make me a cigarette instead.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Always cruel!&rsquo; murmured her companion,
obediently rolling up Turkish tobacco.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Always kind,&rsquo; said the Princess. &lsquo;People
who are kind to men and children never
spoil them. Where will your schooner stay?
There is no dock, or quay, or whatever you
call it, here. These places always ought to
have one of their own.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How can they when the rocks go sheer
down into deep water? No, I must keep her
off Villefranche or Monaco. She can be round
in half an hour&mdash;at your disposition, of course,
like her owner.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If she be not more manageable than her
owner&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Nadine! When I only live to obey
your orders, and never even receive a smile in
return!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, if you want reward there is no longer
any merit! And do not call me by my name
in that manner; you will do it some day before
Platon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;No, of course he does not mind; but I do,
which is more to the purpose.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are very unkind to-day, princess.
This unhappy Jacquemerille! it is grievous that
you don&rsquo;t like it; the gardens are really pretty,
and the view is superb.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You talk like an auctioneer; go and find
the gardener and tell him to untie those
palms.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t send me away yet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is that what you call your docility?&rsquo;</p>

<p>His hand stole towards hers again.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do tell me, princess,&rsquo; he murmured timidly.
&lsquo;You will stay now that you are here, will you
not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How can I answer for the duration of my
fancies? Perhaps I may, if you amuse me well
enough.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I would rather interest you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, my friend, that is quite impossible.
Even to be amused is hard enough, when one
is not in the humour. When one is in the
humour, it is even fun to go out fishing; when
one is not, one is dull even at a masked ball at
Petersburg. We are like the cuttle-fish, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
make our sphere muddy with our own dulness.
How would you suggest that I should find any
interest here? There will be no society except
some gouty statesmen and some sickly women,
a few yachtsmen, a pigeon-shooter or two, and
quantities of people one cannot know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There will be heaps of people who know
you,&rsquo; said Geraldine, almost with a groan; &lsquo;at
least, if you deign to allow them the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</i> of
La Jacquemerille. If I might presume to advise,
the place is all to itself, they cannot come
if you do not invite them. It is as nearly simple
nature here as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mondaine</i> and an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élégante</i>
like you can ever bring herself to go. You
have the sea at your feet and the mountains at
your back; you can have absolute repose and
leisure unless you wilfully bring a horde of men
and women from Nice and Monaco. You are
so clever; you might make endless sketches.
If I were you, I should make it the occasion to
get away from the world a little; if the world
you must have, I should take it in the Avenue
Josephine instead of at La Jacquemerille.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Princess laughed languidly, and looked
at her cigarette.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You want a solitude <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à deux</i>, I daresay!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
But you see there are Platon and Wilkes against
that, not to mention my own inclinations.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pray, be serious.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why? When one is in the mood to be
serious, one does not take a nondescript toy
within five miles of Nice. I daresay you are
right; a quiet life for a little while would be
very wholesome, it would certainly be a novelty,
but it would be beyond me. I am not a stupid
woman, I am not a silly woman certainly; no,
I am quite convinced I have a brain, though
as for a soul, I don&rsquo;t know, and I am afraid I
don&rsquo;t very much care. A brain, however, I
have; Wilkes is even unkind enough to call
me learned. But still, my dear Ralph, I am,
as you observed, that much-abused animal, a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mondaine</i>. When once we belong to the world
can we ever get rid of the world? <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jamais!
au grand jamais!</i> If we try to drink spring
water, we put it somehow or other in a liqueur
glass. If we smell at a hedge-rose, somehow
or other Piver has got in it before us, and given
it the scent of a sachet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are very witty, but&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care in the least for &ldquo;buts,&rdquo; and I
have no pretensions to wit; I leave wit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
whist to the dowagers. No; when we are
once of the world worldly, we never get rid of
the world again. It is our old man of the sea
pickaback with us for ever? Who can lead a
meditative life that dines twice a day, as we
all practically do, and eats of twenty services?
When we prattle about nature, and quote
Matthew Arnold, we are as artificial as the
ribboned shepherdesses of Trianon; and what
we call our high art is only just another sort of
jargon. Suppose I followed your recipe and
tried living quietly here, which means asking
nobody to dinner, what would happen? Wilkes
would go away, Platon would sulk or do worse,
and you and I should yawn in each other&rsquo;s
faces. It is not that I have no brain, I have
even a soul&mdash;if anybody has&mdash;but I began the
other way, you know. It is like taking chloral;
if once you do it you cannot leave off. Society
is entirely like chloral; it gives you pleasant
titillations at first and just the same <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morne</i>
depression afterwards, and yet you cannot do
without it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hope you do without chloral; wait
another twenty years at any rate before you
poison yourself.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Twenty years! I wonder what we shall
be like by then? I daresay I shall be an incurable
hypochondriac, and you will have
several tall boys at Eton. Perhaps your son
will be falling in love with my daughter, and
you and I shall be quarrelling about the settlements.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nadine!&rsquo;</p>

<p>He drew his chair very near indeed, and
looked straight into her eyes. The Princess
looked up at the blue sky, serenely indifferent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is all nonsense, you know,&rsquo; she said,
with a little affected asperity, but she smiled
even if she felt more inclined to yawn. At
that moment there issued from one of the many
glass doors of the nondescript house her
husband, Platon Nicholaivitch Napraxine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear Ralph, I am very glad to see
you,&rsquo; he said cordially, in the tongue of the
boulevards, which every gently born Russian
has taken as his own. &lsquo;You came round in
your &ldquo;tub,&rdquo; as you call her? You have found
the Princess dissatisfied with the house? She
is always dissatisfied with everything, alas!
The house is well enough; the bathrooms are
small, and there is no billiard-room; but other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>wise
I see no defect. Breakfast is waiting and
Lady Brancepeth also. Will you come?&rsquo;</p>

<p>His wife rose languidly, and taking the arm
of Lord Geraldine, drew her skirts of India
muslin, Flemish lace, and primrose satin, over
the marble pavement of the terrace to the
house. Prince Napraxine stood a moment with
his cigar in his mouth, looking south and east
over the sparkling sea, then, with his hands in
his pockets, sauntered also towards the house.</p>

<p>He was a tall, loosely-built man, with an
ugly and frankly Kalmuck face, redeemed by
an expression of extreme good humour; he
was about thirty years of age, and had the air
of a person who had always done what he
chose, and had always been obeyed when he
spoke; but this air changed curiously whenever
he looked at his wife; he had then the timid
and almost supplicating expression of a big
dog, anxious to please, but afraid to offend.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let us go and eat Milo&rsquo;s red mullets,&rsquo; she
said now.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Milo? Is that the cook? Can he do
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouillabaisse</i>, I wonder?&rsquo; he replied.</p>

<p>Their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef</i> had been taken ill, as the
train had touched Bordighera, and their agent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
had hastily supplied his place so far as it is ever
possible to supply that of a great and almost
perfect creature experienced in all the peculiarities
and caprices in taste of those to whom his
art is consecrated.</p>

<p>The Princess took no notice of her lord&rsquo;s
blunder; indeed, she seldom answered his
remarks at any time; she drew her primrose
satin and soft muslin over the sill of the
French window, and seated herself at an oval
table, gay with fine china, with flowers and
fruit, and with a Venice point lace border to
its table cloth, which was strewn with Parma
violets and the petals of orange-blossoms. She
had Geraldine on her right hand and her back
to the light. She had an ermine bag holding
a silver globe of warm water for her feet, and
a chair that was the perfection of ease. The
dining-room was small, but very pretty, with
game and autumn flowers painted on its panels,
and shutters, with hangings of olive velvet and
cornices of dead gold, and on the ceiling a
hunting scene of Fontainebleau <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</i> Henri IV.</p>

<p>She began to think seriously that after all
La Jacquemerille would do very well for the
winter. It was utterly absurd, to be sure, out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>side,
but it was comfortable within; and, indeed,
had considerable taste displayed in it, the
American having wisely mistrusted his own
tendencies and left the whole arrangement to
French artists, who had robbed him ruthlessly,
but who had made each of his apartments as
perfect in its way as a Karl Theodor plate.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think I shall buy it,&rsquo; said the Princess to
her companions; indifferent to her own inconsistencies.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wait a little,&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth.
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t rush from hatred to adoration. There
may be all sorts of things the matter with the
drains. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calorifères</i> may be wrong. The
cellars may be damp. The windows may
rattle. The kitchens may be too far or too
near. At the end of the winter you will know
all its defects and all its virtues. Houses are
like friendships, there is hardly one in a thousand
worth a long lease.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wilkes is always cynical,&rsquo; said her brother.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And nobody is a stauncher friend,&rsquo; said
the Princess. &lsquo;Why will she make herself out
a cynic?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A cynic? Because I am prudent?&rsquo; said
Lady Brancepeth. &lsquo;If you sigh all the winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
because the house is not yours you will enjoy
it. If you buy it you will discover that it is
uninhabitable at once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nadine is never long pleased,&rsquo; said her
husband.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What does Matthew Arnold say?&rsquo; answered
the Princess, &lsquo;that the poet is never happy,
because in nature he wants the world, and in
the world he longs for nature. Now, I am not
a poet, but still I am a little like that. What
you are pleased to call my discontent is a certain
restless sensation that our life&mdash;which we think
the only life&mdash;is a very ridiculous one; and
yet I am quite incapable of leading any other&mdash;for
more than a week. I remember, Geraldine,
that you remarked once that it was this
fool of a world which makes fools of us all.
There was a profound truth in the not very
elegant speech.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember saying it; but it is certainly
true. We grow up in the world as a
Chinese child grows up in the jar which is to
make a dwarf of him. The jar checks our
development <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malgré nous</i>. We cannot be
giants, if we would.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am sure it would not suit you to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
giant, Ralph,&rsquo; said his sister. &lsquo;You would never
like to release distressed damsels and slay disagreeable
dragons. The uttermost you would
ever do to the very biggest dragon would be
to turn an epigram on his odd appearance.
Giants are always very busy people, and you
are so lazy&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is the fault of the jar,&rsquo; said Geraldine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Some people break the jar and get out of
it,&rsquo; said his sister.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, nobody does,&rsquo; said the Princess
Napraxine. &lsquo;You mistake there, Wilkes. The
world is with us always, and we cannot get rid
of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The frank eyes of Geraldine conveyed to
her eloquently his conviction that the discontent
she spoke of was solely due to her determined
banishment of one sentiment out of her life.
She gave him an enigmatical little smile of
comprehension and disbelief combined, and
continued to unroll her philosophies&mdash;or what
did duty as such.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you not know the kind of feeling I
mean? When we are among the orchids in
the conservatories we want to go and gather
damp primroses. Do you not remember that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
queen who, when she heard the gipsies singing
under her windows, all in a moment longed to
go with them? There is something of the
gipsy in everybody&mdash;in everybody who has a
soul. The time comes when one is tired of
the trumpery and folly of it all&mdash;the wicked
expenditure, the dense selfishness and indifference,
the people that call themselves leaders
of good taste, and yet like <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foie gras</i> and the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concours hippique</i> and <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Kümmel</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Londrès</i>,
and the atmosphere of Paris theatres.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Interesting, but discursive,&rsquo; murmured
Lady Brancepeth. &lsquo;Primroses&mdash;gipsies&mdash;a soul&mdash;I
do not see the connection.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You know what I mean,&rsquo; said her hostess,
who always expected to be understood. &lsquo;Our
life is silly, it is tiresome, it is entirely selfish, it
is even, in a way, monstrous; and yet we cannot
live any other. We are dominated by
the Frankenstein of pleasure which we have
been pleased to create. When we wish to get
away we cannot; we are like the queen at the
palace windows&mdash;we would fain go to the
greenwood, and the brook, and the fresh
winds, but we cannot, because we are fastened
in our gilded chair; there is always our house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>hold
to shut the window and send the gipsies
away. Do we ever get rid of the household,
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">galerie</i>, of the routine, of the infinite
ennui? I am only twenty-three years old, as
you all know, and I feel as if I had lived
fifty years. Why? Because it is all over-full,
tiresome, high-pressure; and the worst
of it is that I could lead no other life if I
tried!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am not sure of that,&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth.
&lsquo;Marie Antoinette would never have
believed that she could mend clothes and darn
stockings had not the days of darkness come.
In those days it was just the dainty perfumed
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mignonnes</i> like you, my dear, who were
the bravest and handiest in bearing their
troubles and earning their bread.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;One never knows till one is tried,&rsquo; said
Princess Nadine. &lsquo;If they would begin to
guillotine us I daresay we should know how to
behave; dynamite doesn&rsquo;t do much for us.
When one goes into the air without warning
in little bits, in company with the plaster of the
ceiling, or the skin of the carriage horses, or
the stuffing of the railway carriage, there is not
much room for heroism.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;I am not sure there is no heroism,&rsquo; said
Geraldine. &lsquo;The certainty of the guillotine
must have been much easier to bear than the
uncertainty in which you all dwell in Russia&mdash;the
perpetual spectre always behind your chairs,
beside your pillows, under the roses in your
gardens&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, my dear Geraldine, is not death with
us always everywhere? May we not kill ourselves
every moment we walk downstairs, or
eat a mullet like this, or start on a journey, or
read a book by a night-lamp? You all wonder
how Russians can exist with assassination
always keeping step with them, but in reality
is it so much worse than the way in which
all humanity loves and laughs, and toils and
moils, and makes leases for ninety-nine years,
and contracts foreign loans for payment in a
century, with death hanging over the whole
thing ready to swoop down at any minute?
If the world realised it of course it would go
mad <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>, but it doesn&rsquo;t realise it though
hundreds of people die every second.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did Nadine ever tell you what she did
last year?&rsquo; said Prince Napraxine. &lsquo;She
saw by chance a queer-looking can which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
been placed by some of those miscreants in a
niche of the garden wall of our house in Petersburg;
the thing looked suspicious to her, and
it had a coil of tubing attached to it. She
took the whole affair up and dropped it into
the fountain. She forgot to mention it till the
next morning. Then when we fished it out,
and the chemists reported on it, it appeared
that the can was really full of nitro-glycerine as
she had fancied. I think that was quite as
courageous as going to the guillotine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, no, my dear Platon!&rsquo; said his wife,
with some annoyance. &lsquo;Nothing you have no
time to think about is really courageous. The
can was suspicious and the children were playing
near it, so I thought the fountain was the
safest place; it <em>might</em> have been only milk, you
know. Pray do not let us attempt to compete
with those people of &lsquo;89. We shall fail dismally.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Geraldine looked up with a startled apprehension
in his eyes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good heavens, do you mean it? Has she
actually been&mdash;been&mdash;in such awful danger as
that, and never told me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We were all in the same danger,&rsquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Prince Napraxine, a little drily; &lsquo;but the Princess
alone had the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau rôle</i> out of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who put the can there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, how should I know. The police never
traced it. I do not suppose it was any special
design against us as individuals; only as items
of a detested whole. And two of the Grand
Dukes were coming to breakfast with us that
day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a fuss about an ugly little tin can!&rsquo;
said his wife. &lsquo;The really courageous person
must have been the person who brought it
there; misguided, perhaps, but certainly courageous.
To drive through a city in a droschky
embracing certain annihilation, in the form of
a little tin pot held on your knee, is a combination
of absolute awfulness and grotesque bathos,
which must try all one&rsquo;s nerves without any
compensating sense of grandeur in it. A jolt
of the wheel over a stone and away you fly
into the air, a blurred nothing in a stream of
blood and dust! No; I respect the Nihilists
when I think of all they risk for a purely
abstract idea without any sort of personal hope
or triumph.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They have hatred,&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
&lsquo;I think you forget what an invigorating, self-sustaining,
all-compensating sentiment that is.
Its ecstasy is its own reward. You underrate,
too, the immense fascination of the power to
destroy; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">on se grise</i> with that sense of holding
the annihilation of a whole community in their
hands. What made the Roman Emperors mad,&mdash;the
unlimited power of destruction,&mdash;now intoxicates
the mechanic or the clerk who has
the task of planting a can of nitro-glycerine.
When statesmen, and even philosophers, theorise
about human nature and all its disorders, they
never give weight enough to the tremendous
attraction which pure destruction alone exercises
over so many minds.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But they have love, too; love of the poor
and of a lofty ideal,&rsquo; said the Princess. &lsquo;Myself,
I forgive their little tin cans, though they are
extremely unpleasant, when I think of their
impersonal devotion. All I wish is, that their
warfare was not conducted by tin cans; the
thing has a ludicrous, comical, vulgar side;
death dropped in a little box labelled "glass,
with care"! There is no dignity in it, no
grace. Pallida Mors should not crouch under
a cab-cushion!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;How can you make a jest&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; began
Prince Napraxine. She interrupted him:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am not in the least jesting, I am entirely
in earnest. I do not like being made war on
by chemists; I do not like annihilation left in
a paper parcel; it makes one feel absurd, fate
seems trifling with one. A Jacquerie hewing
at one with their scythes one would know what
to do with, but who can extract any Sophoclean
tragedy from a Thanatus that looks exactly like
a box of sardines or a pot of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foie gras</i>? It
is not the war that I object to, it is the form
it takes; and our great, grim, ghostly Russia
should evolve out of her soul of ice something
much more in consonance with her. Beside the
burning of Moscow, the little tin cans and the
burrowing like moles underground are commonplace
and a little vulgar. Russia is so
awful in herself. One thinks of the frozen
world of the Inferno, and Dante and Virgil
walking in the spectral silence; and then, after
all, in hard fact there is nothing but the police,
and the drunken moujik, and the man who
carries his nitro-glycerine as a baker&rsquo;s boy
carries his rolls of bread! It is bathos.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;One never knows what you mean, Nadine,&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
murmured her husband. &lsquo;If you talk so at
Petersburg they will think you are a Nihilist at
heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I imagine half the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i> are,&rsquo; said the
Princess. &lsquo;The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i> have always dug their
own graves before all revolutions everywhere.
They call it &ldquo;going with the times.&rdquo; They did
it in France, they are now doing it in England,
they are doing it (more secretly) in Russia. No
one should forsake their order; it is a kind of
desertion, like that of a soldier who runs away
before the enemy. That is why I like the party
obedience of your country, Wilkes; it is entirely
unintelligent and profoundly immoral; to
a generally intellectual nation it would be impossible,
but it is loyal. I think when one has
to choose between a crime and a disloyalty one
must take the crime as the lesser evil of the two.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Voting for party is a crime very often,&rsquo;
said Geraldine. &lsquo;It is one of the many things
as to which I have never made up my mind.
Ought one to sacrifice the country to what one
believes a bad measure for the sheer sake of
keeping one&rsquo;s party in office? Surely not.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You solve your doubts by having no
party, and never going into the Lords.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;At least, I can do no mischief.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you certain of that?&rsquo; said his sister.
&lsquo;I think you place voting for party on too low
a plane. If we believe, generally, that one
party&mdash;say it is Conservative, say it is Liberal&mdash;is
necessary to the preservation or the progress
of the nation, then I think we are bound
to do our best to keep it at the helm of the
vessel of the nation, even if in certain minor
matters we are not always in accord with the
course it takes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Admirably reasoned; but are not politicians
always as great sophists as priests?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sophists! always that cruel charge,&rsquo; said a
mellow and manly voice, as there entered the
dining-room a person of handsome and stately
presence, in a picturesque costume, with knee
breeches and buckled shoes, whom the servant
announced as Monsignore Melville. He was
welcomed by all with cordiality and delight,
and the Princess bade him draw his chair beside
her, though he alleged that he had breakfasted.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I came to see if you had arrived,&rsquo; he said,
as he seated himself. &lsquo;Princess, I hope La
Jacquemerille is fortunate enough to please
you?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;I have been abusing it; it is a very
ridiculous house, but it grows upon one; and
if you will come often enough, Monsignore&mdash;&mdash; No,
I never make compliments. You know
you are a delightful companion, and of how
many people can one say that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Monsignore Melville bowed low.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are too enchantingly kind. But all
are not so kind. Lord Geraldine was accusing
priests of sophism. What was he saying?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He was saying that politicians are the
sophists, and Wilkes the head of them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because I defended "voting straight,"&rsquo;
said Lady Brancepeth. &lsquo;Is it not the very root
and essence of English constitutional life?
Monsignore Melville, who is an Englishman,
will, I am sure, say so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To serve the Church is only a superior
kind of voting with party,&rsquo; said Geraldine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do not be profane, Ralph,&rsquo; said his sister.
&lsquo;It does not suit you. You were created
with a reverential nature, and you have
endeavoured to ruin it, as most men always do
try to destroy what is best in them. Monsignore,
answer me, is it not the highest
morality to vote straight?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;That is a very unlimited laudation, Lady
Brancepeth,&rsquo; returned Melville, with a charming
smile. &lsquo;I should be scarcely prepared to go so
far, though I am aware that there is no salvation
outside such morality in the political creed
of our country.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ecclesiastics have no country, my dear
Monsignore,&rsquo; said the Princess Napraxine, &lsquo;except
a heavenly one. What a comfort that
must be! Platon is always being worried to
return to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mater patria</i>, and his conscience
is so peculiarly constituted that it will never
allow him to admit how intensely he hates it.
As if life were not tiresome enough in itself,
without everyone being burdened with the
obligation to like, or pretend that they like,
their country, their relatives, their children,
and their church!&mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Napraxine looked distressed:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have liked Russia, too, sometimes,&rsquo;
he said wistfully; &lsquo;and poor little Sachs and
Mitz!&rsquo;</p>

<p>His wife cast upon him a glance of sovereign
disdain: &lsquo;There are only two things I
like in Russia, they are the steppes and the
wolves: that limitless expanse, stretching away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to the dim grey sky on every side, and the
sight of a pack of the gaunt grey beasts on the
snow as one&rsquo;s sledge flies by; those two things
give one a sensation which one does not get
elsewhere. But it is monotonous, it soon ceases
to move one; the wolves never attack, and the
great, awful, white plain never leads to anything
better than the posting-house, the samavàr,
and the vodki, and the group of drunken
coachmen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The human interest, in a word,&rsquo; suggested
Melville.</p>

<p>Madame Napraxine smiled:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! my dear Monsignore, the human interest
is quite as dull as the steppe and quite
as ravenous as the wolf! How delightful it
must be to be a priest to see all that raw
material through rose-glasses!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;May not the interest be in subduing the
wolf?&rsquo; murmured Melville. &lsquo;And even the
steppe, under the fostering touch of May dews
and June sunlight, will put forth blossoms. Is
there no allegory there that Madame Napraxine
will deign to accept?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You always say pretty things, in the pulpit
or out of it,&rsquo; she replied; &lsquo;but you cannot lend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
me your rose-glasses to see them through, so I
fear they do not convince me. The astronomers
who are now busy seeing canals in the
planet Mars, would see nothing if they had not
their glasses; no more would you. You see a
soul in a drunken <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">dvornik</i>; that is quite as
astonishing, and probably quite as imaginary,
as the network of canals in Mars. Will you
really eat nothing, Monsignore? Let us go out
and sit under that awning there; a bath of
sunshine always does one good, and you need
not grudge yourself a half hour of leisure. I
have no doubt you have been passing the forenoon
somewhere with cholera or typhus or
some other plague of this sanitary century.
You know, Geraldine, that is Monsignore&rsquo;s way.
He is S. Francis Xavier all the morning, and
then turns himself inside out and becomes an
Abbé <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">galant</i> for society.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have not been to anything typhoid or
choleraic this morning, or I should not be here
to endanger your loveliness, Princess,&rsquo; answered
Melville. &lsquo;I have been where Poverty is&mdash;alas!
where is she not?&mdash;and in our day those
who wed with her regard it as a forced marriage,
wholly joyless; and we cannot persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
them that there may be graciousness where she
dwells if only cleanliness and content will sit
down with her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Monsignore, it is not only poverty that
scares content, I can assure you,&rsquo; said Madame
Napraxine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you be not content, who should be?&rsquo;
murmured Melville. &lsquo;With every possible gift
of nature, culture, fate, and fortune showered
upon you, why will you always persuade yourself,
Princess, that your doubled rose-leaf mars
everything? I do not believe the rose-leaf
even exists!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am not sure that it does, either,&rsquo; replied
Madame Napraxine; &lsquo;but I never remember
to have felt contented in my life. Is content
an intellectual quality? I doubt it. Perhaps
it is a virtue; I dislike virtues.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Melville was a sincerely pious Churchman,
but even he did not dare to take up the cudgels
in honour of poor virtue before this merciless
speaker. He was satisfied with replying that
content was not a quality which the tendencies
of the waning nineteenth century were likely
to foster.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; said the Princess Napraxine. &lsquo;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
note of our time is restlessness, and its chief
attainment the increase of insanity.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If it did not sound too much like moralising,
I should say that there was never any
time in which there was so much self-indulgence
and so little real rest,&rsquo; said Melville,
who had the sensitive fear of a man of the
world of appearing to obtrude his own convictions,
and to preach out of season and out of
church.</p>

<p>&lsquo;People require to have their brains and
their consciences very clear and very calm to
enjoy rest. It is the reward which nature reserves
for her good children,&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I must be very good, then,&rsquo; said Madame
Napraxine with her little mysterious smile, &lsquo;for
I rest absolutely. To know how to do nothing
is a great secret of health and of comfort; but
you must not wait till you are fatigued to do
nothing, or you cannot enjoy it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And I suppose you must occasionally be
deaf to duty knocking at the door?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Duty! She should have her proper moments
of audience, like the steward, the piqueur, the
secretary, and other necessary and disagree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>able
people; that is to say, if she really exist.
Monsignore Melville evidently is in the habit of
listening to her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I may say with Josef II., "C&rsquo;est mon
métier à moi,"&rsquo; said Melville, with good
humour. &lsquo;But believe me, Princess, it is not
duty which prevents repose; it is far more
often worry, the hateful familiar of all modern
life. Worry takes a million forms; very often
it is dressed up as pleasure, and perhaps in that
shape is more distressing than in any other.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, the age has invented nothing that
does not result in worry. Only look at the
torture to diplomatists from the telegrams,&rsquo; replied
Madame Napraxine, while she tendered
him a cigar. &lsquo;In other years an ambassador
had some pleasure in disentangling a delicate
and intricate embroglio, some chance of making
a great name by his skill in negotiation. An
able man was let alone to mingle his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">suaviter</i>
and his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fortiter</i>, his honey and his aloes, as he
thought fit; his knowledge of the country to
which he was accredited was trusted to and
appreciated; nowadays, telegrams rain in on
him with every hour; he is allowed no initiative,
no independent action; he is dictated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and interfered with by his home government,
and cypher messages torture him at every step.
What is the consequence? That there is
scarcely a diplomatist left in Europe&mdash;they
are only delegates. Where there is one, he is
incessantly controlled, hindered, and annoyed,
and all his counsels are disregarded. Meanwhile
the world&rsquo;s only kind of peace is a permanent
armed truce. But let us go into the
garden.&rsquo;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p>When Nadège Fedorevna, Countess Platoff,
known to all her friends by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit nom</i> of
Nadine, had reached her sixteenth year she had
the look of a hothouse gardenia, so white was
her skin and so spiritual her aspect, whilst her
slender form had all the grace of a flower
balancing itself on a fragile stalk in a south
wind. That ethereality, that exquisite delicacy,
as of something far too fair and evanescent for
man&rsquo;s rude touch, fascinated into a timid and
adoring passion a heavily-built and clumsy
cuirassier of the Imperial Guard, who was also
one of the greatest nobles written in the Velvet
Book of Russia&mdash;Platon Nicholaivitch, head
of the mighty family of Napraxine. He was
eight-and-twenty years old, immeasurably rich,
popular with his sovereign, a good soldier, and
an exceedingly amiable man. He laid his
heart and everything he possessed at the feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of this exquisite and disdainful child when he
saw her at her father&rsquo;s embassy in Vienna one
fateful April day.</p>

<p>She refused him without a moment of
doubt; but he was persevering, greatly enamoured,
and had both her parents upon his
side. She was neither weak, nor very obedient;
yet in time she allowed herself to be persuaded
that not to accept such an alliance would be
to do something supremely ridiculous. She
resisted stubbornly for a while; but she was
inquisitive, independent, and a little heartless.</p>

<p>Her mother, a woman of the world, full of
tact and of wisdom, answered her objection
that the Prince Napraxine was stupid, had a
Kalmuck face, and was inclined to be corpulent&mdash;in
a word, displeased her taste in every
way&mdash;by frankly admitting these objections to
be incontestable facts, but added, with persuasive
equanimity, &lsquo;All you say is quite true, my
child, but that sort of details does not matter,
I assure you, in a question of the kind we are
discussing. It would matter terribly to him if
you were stupid or ugly, or inclined to be fat;
but in a man&mdash;in a husband&mdash;in three months&rsquo;
time you will not even observe it. Indeed, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
a fortnight you will be so used to him that you
will not think whether he is handsome or ugly.
Familiarity is a magician that is cruel to beauty,
but kind to ugliness. As for being inclined to
corpulence, he is very tall, he will carry it off
very well; and as to gambling, he will never
get to the bottom of his salt mines and ruby
mines: that is the chief question. And after
all, my dear Nadine, a man who will never
interfere with you and never quarrel with you
is a pearl seldom found amongst the husks; and
when the pearl is set in gold&mdash;&mdash; I would not
for worlds persuade you, my dear, to marry
merely for certain worldly considerations, such
as the great place and the great wealth of
Platon Nicholaivitch; but I would earnestly advise
you to marry early and to marry for peace,
and when peace and a colossal fortune are to
be found united, it seems to me a great mistake
to throw them both away. Somebody else
will take them. I suppose you dream of love
as all young girls do; but&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not at all; I know this is only a question
of marriage,&rsquo; said Nadine, with that terrible
sarcasm on her lovely young lips with which
many things she had seen in her mother&rsquo;s house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
had armed her for the battle of life whilst she
was still but a child.</p>

<p>She did not think about love at all; she
was not romantic; she already thought it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vieux
jeu</i>; but she had a brain above the average,
and she fancied that she should like the man
to whom she was given to be something great
in intellectual power, not merely in the sense of
millions and of rank. But a girl of sixteen,
born and bred in an embassy, reared in the
most brilliant cities of the world, having seen
the great panorama of society pass before her
eyes from her babyhood, is, however innocent
in other ways, not unsophisticated enough to
ignore the vast advantages of such a position
and such wealth as the Prince Napraxine offered
to her. Besides, her father wished passionately
for the acceptance of Napraxine; he himself
was deeply in debt, and knew that his constitution
had the germs of a mortal disease.</p>

<p>&lsquo;V&rsquo;là, ma petite,&rsquo; he said to her gravely one
morning, &lsquo;je suis criblé de dettes: je peux
mourir demain. C&rsquo;est mieux que tu le
prennes&mdash;&mdash; enfin, c&rsquo;est un assez bon garçon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was not an enthusiastic eulogy of his
desired son-in-law, but he never spoke enthu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>siastically,
and his child knew very well that
under the negligent slight phrases there ran a
keen and vivid desire, perhaps even a carking
and unacknowledged care. By the end of that
evening she had allowed herself to be persuaded,
and in three months&rsquo; time was married
to Prince Napraxine, not knowing in the least
what marriage was, but only regarding it as
an entry into the world with unlimited jewels
and the power of going to any theatres she
chose. When she did know what it was, it
filled her with an inexpressible disgust and
melancholy. She was very young, and her
temperament was composed of that mingled
hauteur and spirituality in which the senses
sleep silent long, sometimes for ever.</p>

<p>She bore two sons in the first two years of
her marriage, and then considered herself free
from further obligations to provide heirs for
the vast Napraxine properties. Her husband
had been ardently but timidly in love; when
she intimated to him that their union should be
restricted to going to Courts together and being
seen in the same houses at discreet intervals, he
suffered in his affections as well as in his pride,
but he did not dare to rebel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>This lovely young woman, who was like
a gardenia or a narcissus, who was not
nineteen, and declared that all the caresses and
obligations of love were odious to her, could
strike terror and submission into the soul of
the big Platon Napraxine, who stood six feet
three inches, and had been no unheroic soldier
in the frosty Caucasus and on the banks of
Euphrates and Indus. She was unusually
clever, clever by nature and culture, by intellect
and insight, keenly, delicately clever, with both
aptitude and appetite for learning and scholarship;
and within the first twenty-four hours of
her marriage, she had taken his measurement,
moral and mental, with merciless accuracy, and
had decided to herself that she would never do
but what she chose. He was a big dog, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon
enfant</i>, a good-natured, good-tempered cipher,
but he was a great bore. And she put him
aside out of her life altogether, except inasmuch
as it was absolutely necessary to sit sometimes
at the same table with him, and have his orders
blaze beside her diamonds at State balls; and
the friends of the Prince Napraxine envied her,
of all her valuable possessions, none so much
as that of her husband, whose revenues were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
inexhaustible, and whose good-nature and
patience were equally endless.</p>

<p>Looking back to her seventeenth year she
always admitted that her mother had judged
rightly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor Platon!&rsquo; she would say to herself
sometimes when she thought so, with a little
passing flicker of something like compunction.
What had she given him in return for his great
name, his enormous wealth, his magnificent
gifts of all kinds, his honest devotion, and his
infinite docility? Being very honest, when in
self-communion of this sort, she was obliged to
confess to herself&mdash;nothing. Her own money
was all settled on herself; their rank had been
quite equal; there were hundreds as pretty as
herself, and she could not now recollect that in
six years of marriage she had given him one
affectionate word.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The fault is not ours;&rsquo; she would say, &lsquo;it
is the institution that is so stupid. People
do not know how else to manage about property,
and so they invented the marriage state.
But it is an altogether illogical idea, binding
down two strangers side by side for ever, and
it cannot be said to work well. It keeps pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>perty
together, that is all; so I suppose it is
good for the world; but certainly individuals
suffer for it more than perhaps property is
worth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Her two little boys were always left in the
Krimea with the mother of Napraxine; they
were much better there, she thought, growing
up robust and healthy like two young bear cubs
(which, to her eyes, they much resembled) in
the pure breezes from the Black Sea. When
she did see them she was always amiable to
them, even thought she felt fond of them, as
she did of the steppes and the wolves; but
like the steppes and the wolves they were
certainly most interesting in theory and at a
good long distance. They were too like their
father to be welcome to her. &lsquo;They have the
Tartar face, and they will be just as big and
just as stupid,&rsquo; she thought, whenever she saw
them.</p>

<p>When Melville, who had been long intimate
with her family, told her, as he very often did,
that it was her duty to have the children near
her, and to interest herself in their education,
she always replied: &lsquo;They are exactly like
Platon; nothing I could do would make them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
different. They are perfectly well cared for by
his mother, and brought up much better than I
could do it. I was expected to give him an
heir: I have given him two heirs. I do not
see that anything more is required of me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And when Melville would fain have insisted
on the usual arguments as to the obligations of
maternity and education, she invariably interrupted
him, and once said at full length, &lsquo;If
the children were mine only and not Platon&rsquo;s,
I could make something of them. But they
are formed in his image; exceedingly good,
entirely uninteresting. They will be Princes
Napraxine, and so the world will adore them,
though they be as stupid as mules and as
ugly as hedgehogs. They do not interest me.
Oh, you are shocked! Even you, the most
original of Churchmen, cannot get over your
prejudices. Believe me, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la voix de la Nature</i>
does not speak to everybody. It does not say
anything at all to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will be an honest woman; it is much
more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</i>,&rsquo; she had said to herself in the
first year of her marriage in the height
of a Paris winter, as she had looked around
her on society, with her brilliant indolent eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
which saw so clearly and so far, and surveyed
and appraised her contemporaries.</p>

<p>It would be eccentric, but distinguished.
To her delicate, satirical, fastidious taste, there
was a sort of vulgarity in being compromised.
She did not go farther than that, or higher than
that. The thing was common, was low; that
was quite enough against it. Something that
was half spirituality, half hauteur, made the
decision easy to her. A certain chillness of
temper aiding, her resolve had been kept.
She had been as loyal a wife to Prince Napraxine
as though she had loved him. Men
did not obtain any hold on her. She flirted
desperately sometimes, amused herself always,
but that was all. When they tried to pass from
courtiers into lovers, they found a barrier, impalpable
but impassable, compounded of her
indifference and her raillery, ever set between
her and them. She fancied that it would be
quite intolerable to her for any living being to
believe himself necessary to her happiness;
besides, she did not much believe in happiness.
The world was pleasant enough; like a well-cushioned
saloon carriage on a well-ordered
line of rail; nothing more. You travelled on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>ward,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malgré vous</i>, and you slept comfortably,
and your ultimate destination you could not
avoid; but if you escaped any great disaster by
the way, and if nobody woke you with a shock,
it was all you wanted. She did not believe in
the possibility of any great beatitude coming
to you on that very monotonous route.</p>

<p>She had that admirable tact coupled with
that refined but unsparing insolence which
daunts the world in general to silence and
respect. The greatest <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blagueur</i> on the Boulevards
never dared to hint at a weakness or
a concession on the part of the Princess Napraxine.
And women, though they envied her
bitterly, reviled her unsparingly, and shivered
under the sting of her delicate impertinence
or her pregnant epigram, yet were perfectly
conscious that she had never shared their
follies. Passion had as yet no place in her
complex and delicate organism. She could
not, or would not, understand why passion
should not be content to amuse and worship
her, just as a furnace fire may only bake
a porcelain cup or call to life a gardenia
blossom.</p>

<p>Now and then this refusal of hers to compre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>hend
what she inspired ended in dire tragedy.
Now and then some one killed himself because
she had laughed. Now and then two people
were silly enough to fight a duel about a glove
she had dropped, or the right to take her down
the stairs at the opera. But this was always
lamentable and foolish in her sight; only its
consequences, though she regretted them, did
not alter her. If she had loved her husband her
victims would have been less mortified; but
they all knew very well that Platon Napraxine
was no more to her than one of the chairs in
her drawing-room. If she had even loved the
world she lived in, her coldness would have
been more intelligible; but she did not. Her
magnificent jewels, her marvellous toilettes, her
many beautiful houses, her power of gratifying
any whim as it formed itself, the way people
looked after her postillions in their blue velvet
jackets, the perpetual fête of which society was
made up for her, all diverted her but moderately.
She was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mondaine</i> to the tips of her
fingers, but not enthusiastically so, only so from
habit&mdash;as she wore silk stockings or had rose-water
in her bath.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have seen the whole thing since I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sixteen; how can it entertain me much?&rsquo; she
said to those who marvelled at her indifference.
When it was objected to her that there were
many who had seen it from sixteen to sixty,
and yet thought nothing else worth seeing, she
shrugged her shoulders. On the whole she
understood the sect of the Skoptzi better; they
had an ideal. What ideal had her world?</p>

<p>She kept her exquisite tint and her lovely
eyes unspoiled by the endless late hours and
the incessant excitations in which women of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monde où l&rsquo;on s&rsquo;amuse</i> lose their youth in a
year or two. She ate very simply, drank little
but water, rode or drove no matter what
weather, refused forty-nine out of fifty of all
the invitations she received, seldom or never
made any house visits, and spent many hours
in perfect repose.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why should you go and stay in other
people&rsquo;s houses?&rsquo; she always said to her English
friends, in whom this mania is more rampant
than amongst any other nationality. &lsquo;Another
person&rsquo;s house is hardly better than an hotel;
indeed, very often it is worse. If you don&rsquo;t like
the dinner-hour, you cannot change it; if you
are given slow horses, you cannot complain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
if you dislike your rooms, you cannot alter
them; if you think the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef</i> a bad one, you
cannot say so; if you find all the house party
bore you, you cannot get rid of them. You
must pretend to eat all day long; you must
pretend to feel amiable from noon to midnight;
you must have all kinds of plans made
for you, and submit to them; you can never
read but in your own room, and, generally
speaking, there is nothing in the library&mdash;if it
be an English library&mdash;except Tennyson, Wordsworth,
and Mr. Darwin. I cannot imagine how
any reasonable being subjects herself to such a
martyrdom only because somebody else finds
their country place dull without people.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She had also ingeniously established a
reputation for very delicate health, which she
found beyond anything useful to spare her from
being bored, and to excuse her absence from
any gathering which did not specially attract
her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">santé de fer</i>,&rsquo; she said once to a
friend, &lsquo;but happily I look very fragile, and
physicians, if they think you wish it, will always
promise you angina pectoris or tubercles on
your lungs. I have an enchanting doctor in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Paris&mdash;you know him, de Thiviers&mdash;he is very
famous; he will shake his head over me as if
I were doomed to die in ten minutes, and he
frightens Platon out of his wits&mdash;he gets a great
many rouleaux at the end of the season&mdash;and
he and I look as grave as the two augurs,
though, like the augurs, we are both longing
to laugh. It is so useful to be thought very
delicate, you have an excuse for everything.
If at the last moment you don&rsquo;t wish to go anywhere,
nobody can say anything if it be your
health that gives way. They would never forgive
me my continual absence from the Court
at Petersburg, and I certainly should not receive
my perpetual passport, if they did not
sincerely believe in the tubercles which de
Thiviers has so obligingly found for me. Do
go to de Thiviers if you are quite well and
want to be ill; he understands all that sort of
thing so well, and he never betrays you. He
has convinced Platon that I am <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poitrinaire</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And between her reputation for a dangerous
disease in her system, and her really intelligent
care of her health, she had the paths of life
made very smooth to her, and was infinitely
freer from any genuine indisposition than might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
have been expected from the fragility of her
aspect, and her Russian love of hot rooms and
yellow tea. Still, as a great comedian will so
identify himself with his part that he at times
believes himself the thing which he represents,
she did at times almost persuade herself, as she
completely persuaded others, that she had some
great constitutional delicacy to contend with,
and she would play at medicine with little
needles for morphia, or a few glasses of water
at Baden-Baden or Ems, as she would play now
and then at baccarat or roulette in her drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nothing is so useful,&rsquo; she would say in
moments of confidence. &lsquo;Look at the quantity
of weariness that there is in the world from
which no other possible plan will set you free.
Palace dinners, diplomatic banquets, great marriages,
country house visits, self-invited princes,
imperial coronations, royal baptisms,&mdash;you cannot
refuse them; the laws of society forbid;
but if you are known to be in delicate health,
no one can be offended if, at the last moment,
quite unexpectedly, you get a chill and must
not stir out of your own room. When there
is some unutterable social tedium looming on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the horizon, I always telegraph for de Thiviers,
and he is always equal to the occasion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In this, as in other matters, she arranged
her life to her own satisfaction, without any
kind of misgiving that this self-absorption was
egotistical. Everything had combined to make
her an egotist. An only child, adored by her
father, admired and a little feared by her
mother, whose most intimate secrets she had
divined with all the keen intuition of her natural
intelligence; surrounded from her earliest years
by a court of dependents and servants who
seemed only to live to minister to her caprices,
flattered from her babyhood by all her father&rsquo;s
friends, secretaries, and attachés, she had imbibed
selfishness as inevitably as a young
willow sucks in the moisture from the stream
by which it grows. There was nothing in a
loveless marriage and in the clumsy and irritating
devotion of a man who was ardently
in love with her, whilst she only viewed him
with contempt and dislike, to counteract the
influences of her earlier years. The whole
world conspired to induce the Princess Napraxine
to live only for herself.</p>

<p>That she occasionally had moments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
supreme generosity, and a capacity seldom or
never called out for heroic courage, did not
alter the main fact that her life was essentially
selfish. She never did anything that she did
not wish to do; the great want in her existence,
to herself, was that she so very seldom
felt any wish for anything. When she did, she
gratified it without any scruple or hesitation.</p>

<p>Her mind was too clear and logical for any
creed to obtain any hold upon her; nominally,
of course, she was of the Greek Church, and
had too much good taste to create any scandal
by openly separating herself from it; but her
intelligence, as critical and as subtle as Voltaire&rsquo;s
or Bolingbroke&rsquo;s, would no more have submitted
to the bondage of religious superstition
and tradition than she would have clothed her
graceful person in one of the &lsquo;Décrochez-moi-ça&rsquo;
that hung in the windows of Paris clothes-shops.
In morality, also, she did not much
believe; she read Stuart Mill&rsquo;s plea for the
utility of virtue once, and smiled as she closed
the book with a mental verdict of &lsquo;non-proven.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Pride (that pride which has been happily
defined by a French writer as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas d&rsquo;orgueil,
mais de la fierté</i>), and the delicacy of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
taste, with her profound indifference, supplied
the place in her of moral laws, and probably
acted on her much more effectively than they
would have done. Principle is but a palisade;
temperament is a stone bastion.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Les honnêtes gens m&rsquo;ennuient et les mauvaises
gens me déplaisent,&rsquo; she was wont to say,
with a frank confession of what many others
have felt, and have not had the courage to say.
She had no more rigidity of principle than
any other person who has been reared in the
midst of a witty, elegant, and corrupt society;
but her perfect taste supplied the place of moral
convictions, the grossness of vice offended her
like a bad odour, or a staring colour; and
everything loose or coarse seemed to her an
affront to intelligence and to refinement.</p>

<p>Sometimes she almost envied the women
who could plunge themselves into the hot
springs of a passion, only it seemed to her
vulgar; the same sort of vulgarity as swimming
in public in a rose-coloured <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maillot</i>. She
could swim like an otter, but she never swam
in public. The noisy and ungrateful pleasures
which delight modern society seemed to her
sheer imbecilities, whilst she would as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
have descended to an intrigue with her cook
or her coachman as have made an amorous
appointment in a private room at a café, or
have mounted the stairs of a hired house to
meet a Lovelace of the clubs. &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Peut-on être
plus bête!</i>&rsquo; she would say, with supreme disdain,
whenever she heard of the vulgarities which
usually accompany Apate and Philotes in these
the waning years of the nineteenth century.
She quite understood the Parisienne in &lsquo;Frou-frou&rsquo;
who, tempted to make an assignation,
awakes to a sense of its coarseness and commonness
when she finds that the temple of love
is upon the third floor in the Rue du Petit
Hurleur, and that the wall-paper has five-and-twenty
Poniatowskys jumping into the
Elster repeated on every length of it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;In that sort of affair,&rsquo; she said once, &lsquo;you
must have either secrecy or a scandal; both to
me seem in bad taste. And then, with the one
you are at the mercy of your maid, and with the
other you are at the mercy of the newspapers.
To be sure,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;I cannot, perhaps,
measure the force of the temptation, for I have
never in my life seen any human being to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
whom I should have ever thought it worth while
even to order out my <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coupé</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Innumerable lives had done their uttermost
to entwine themselves in hers and had only
broken themselves helplessly on the rock of
her supreme indifference, like so many ships
upon icebergs. She was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">charmeresse</i> in the
uttermost sense of that expressive word, but
she was scarcely a coquette, though the most
merciless coquetry might have done much less
harm than she did. A coquette desires and
strives to please; Nadine Napraxine fascinated
other lives to hers without effort if without
pity. She had one supreme end&mdash;to endeavour
to amuse herself; and she had one unending
appetite&mdash;that of the study of character.
She so seldom succeeded in amusing
herself that she came naturally to the conclusion
that most characters contained no amusing
elements.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous m&rsquo;ennuyez!</i>&rsquo; was her single word of
explication to those whose homage she had
permitted for a while only to send them adrift
without a sign of compassion or contrition. To
her the three words seemed entirely comprehensive.
When some one more daring than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the others had once ventured to remind her
that he had not been quite so hateful to her
only a brief while before, she had said, with
some impatience, &lsquo;Can one know that a book
is dull unless one looks at a few pages? It is
not one&rsquo;s fault if it be ill-written. I cannot say
why you all weary me, but if you do, it is
not my fault either.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When once they wearied her it was of no
use for them by any ingenuity, subserviency, or
despair, to attempt to regain her favour. Her
path, like that of all great victors, was strewn
with unregarded victims. Now and then her
composure had been ruffled, when the fate of
someone of these had roused the adverse
comments of the world, and the issue of some
duel or the fact of some suicide had had her
name, by common consent, coupled with it.
She disliked that kind of notoriety; sincerely
disliked it with all the hauteur and disgust of
a very proud and sensitive refinement; but it
never made her change the tenor of her ways.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you do not like <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">du potin</i>, would it not
be better&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;not to give rise to it?&rsquo;
Napraxine himself had once humbly ventured
to suggest when she was excessively angered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
because the journals of the hour had ventured
to introduce her name into their narratives of
a duel ending in the death of the young Principe
d&rsquo;Ivrea, who had been very popular and
beloved in French and Italian society.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Du potin!</i>&rsquo; she had echoed. &lsquo;Why cannot
you say scandal? What sense is there in
slang? Give rise to it? Ivrea was a nice
boy, but irascible like all Italians, and intensely
vain; the least word irritated him. He chose
to provoke de Prangins because de Prangins
teased him, and the old man has been too
strong for the young one. It is a great pity!
he had a pretty face and a pretty manner, but
I have no more to do with his death than the
gilt arrow on the top of the house. Myself,
I would much rather he had killed de Prangins.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Napraxine had preserved a reverential
silence; he knew that there was another side
to the story, but he did not venture to say so.</p>

<p>When the jealousies, feuds, and quarrels
which it amused her to excite and foment
arrived at any such tragical conclusion as this
with which the Duc de Prangins had disembarrassed
her salons of a youth who of late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
had grown too presuming, she was always
entirely innocent of being the cause of it. &lsquo;I
always tell them to like each other,&rsquo; she would
say placidly; but therein they did not obey her.</p>

<p>She valued her power of destruction as the
only possible means of her own amusement. It
reconciled her to herself when she was most disposed
to be discontented. Her delicate lips smiled
with ineffable disdain when she saw other women
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">se tordant comme des folles</i>, as she expressed it,
in their effort to secure the admiration or retain
the passions of men, while she, merely lifting
the cloud of her black lashes in the sunshine by
the lake, or sitting still as marble in the shadow
of her box at the &lsquo;Français,&rsquo; could anchor
down by her for ever the thoughts, the desires,
the regrets, the destinies of young and old, of
friend and enemy, of stranger and familiar,
merely by the passive magnetism of that charm
which Nature had given her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Marie Stuart,&rsquo; she said once when she
closed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chastelard</i>, &lsquo;a sorceress! Pooh! They
make much too much of her. She had a charm,
I suppose, but she could not have known how
to use it, or she would never have married
either Darnley or Bothwell, and she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
never have allowed herself to be beaten by
Elizabeth&mdash;a grey-haired virgin and a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maîtresse
femme</i>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>All women seemed to her to have been
very weak: Josephine humiliated at Malmaison;
Marie Antoinette, on the tumbril of death;
Heloise, in her cell of Paraclete; Lady Hamilton,
dying of want in Calais; Lady Blessington,
poor and miserable in Paris:&mdash;what was
the use of &lsquo;charm&rsquo; if it ended like that?</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall reign as long as I live,&rsquo; she said to
herself. &lsquo;And if I live to eighty men will be
still eager to hear me talk.&rsquo;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;This room is stifling, it is so small; and yet
there are horrible draughts in it. I dare say the
ridiculous walls are not an inch thick,&rsquo; said the
Princess Napraxine now, as she rose from the
breakfast-table, and drew her delicate skirts,
with their undulating waves and foam of lace,
out through the glass doors and over the marble
of the terrace to the sheltered nook in which
she had been sitting before breakfast, where a
square Smyrna carpet was placed under several
cushioned lounging-chairs. It was only two
o&rsquo;clock, and the air was warm and full of
brilliant sunshine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is all in dreadful taste,&rsquo; she said for the
hundredth time. &lsquo;This sort of mock-Syrian
scenery, mixed up with châlets, villas, and
hotels, has such a look of the stage. It seems
made on purpose for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maquillées</i> beauties, dyed
and pampered gamblers, and great ladies who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
are received nowhere else. Places have all a
physiognomy, moral as well as physical. The
Riviera must have been enchanting when there
was only a mule-track as wide as a ribbon
between the hills and the sea from Marseilles
to Genoa, but now that the moral emanations
of Monte Carlo and of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cinq heures</i> at all
the nondescript houses, and of the baccarat
groups in the clubs which are not as exclusive
as they might be, have spread all along
the coast like miasma, the whole thing is only
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">décor de scène</i>, the very gardens are masquerading
as Egypt, as Damascus, as Palermo.
It is all <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">postiche</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are very cruel, madame,&rsquo; murmured
Melville.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is the only thing you can any of you
find to reply when I say anything that is true!&rsquo;
said the Princess, with triumph.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The de Vannes are your nearest neighbours,&rsquo;
suggested her husband.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did you mean that Cri-Cri is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien nature</i>?&rsquo;
she said, with her little low laugh. &lsquo;I fear
neither of them will contribute anything to
redeem the character of the place for either
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maquillage</i> or gambling&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Why would you come to it?&rsquo; he asked,
with all a man&rsquo;s stupidity.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why do people ever ask one why one
does things?&rsquo; she interrupted, irritably. &lsquo;One
imagines one will like a thing; one gets it;
and directly, of course, one does not like
it. That is a kind of general law. Monsignore
Melville will tell us, I suppose, that it
is to prevent us attaching ourselves to the
pleasures of this world; but as it also operates
in preventing one&rsquo;s attaching oneself to
anybody, as well as anything, I do not know
that the result is as admirable as he would
imagine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I never said&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; began Melville.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, no, but you would say if you were in
the pulpit,&rsquo; she replied, before he could finish
his sentence. &lsquo;You would say that even <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>
and satiety and depression have their uses if
they lead the soul to heaven; but that is just
what they do not do; they only lead to morphia,
chloral, dyspepsia, and Karlsbad. It is
quite impossible&mdash;it must be quite impossible,
even for you, Monsignore&mdash;to consider Karlsbad
as an antechamber to heaven!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Melville tried to look shocked, but did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
succeed well, as he was a little Rabelaisian and
Montaignist at heart, and not intended by
nature for a Churchman.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What are we going to do?&rsquo; said the
Prince, as he stretched himself in his chair, and
lighted another cigarette.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stay where we are,&rsquo; suggested Geraldine,
who desired nothing better, as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>
was a favour never accorded to him twice in
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, not I, indeed!&rsquo; cried Napraxine, with
as much alacrity as was possible beneath his
heavy &lsquo;envelope of flesh.&rsquo; &lsquo;I shall go to Monte
Carlo. I have told them to harness. If you
like to come&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>At that moment a servant brought him a
card. He read what was written in pencilled
lines upon it; then raised his head with a
pleased exclamation.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je vous le donne en mille!</i>&rsquo; he cried.
&lsquo;Nadine, who do you think is here?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A goose with a diseased liver, or a hundred
green oysters?&rsquo; said his wife, contemptuously.
&lsquo;I can imagine no lesser source for
so much radiance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Prince, regardless of sarcasm, or tem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>pered
to endurance of it by long habit, answered
placidly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; it is Othmar.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The face of Nadine Napraxine changed
considerably; the most astute observer could
not have decided whether annoyance or gratification
was the most visible expression; her
eyes lighted with a look different to the mild
amusement with which she had greeted
Geraldine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where can he have come from?&rsquo; continued
her husband. &lsquo;He was in Asia a little while
ago. One is always so glad to see him. He
is so unlike other people. It is only you,
Nadine, who do not appreciate him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poseur</i>,&rsquo; said she with languor. &lsquo;But
I do not know whether that is reason enough
to keep him waiting at the gate?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I forgot,&rsquo; said Napraxine. &lsquo;There is no
one less <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poseur</i>, I assure you. Clever as you
are, you sometimes mistake. Grégor, beg Count
Othmar to join us here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The servant withdrew. Princess Nadine
put a large peacock fan between her and the
sun; she yawned a little.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Seven minutes for Grégor to send down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to the gate, seven minutes for Othmar to come
up from the gate, a minute and a half more for
him to traverse the house; we have fifteen
minutes and a half in which to vilify our
coming friend, as modern hospitality binds us
to do. Let us begin. We must be stupid
indeed if we cannot kill anybody&rsquo;s character
in a quarter of an hour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is no character to kill,&rsquo; began her
husband.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pardon me! No one can say he is characterless.
He is a very marked character.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That was not what I meant,&rsquo; said Napraxine.
&lsquo;I meant that no one could say
otherwise than good of him. And if there
were such a one, he should not say it before
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nadine Napraxine let her eye rest on her
husband with a peculiar expression, half pity,
half derision, which might have given him
plentiful food for reflection, had he been a man
who ever reflected.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor Platon! He has all the antique
virtues!&rsquo; she said softly. &lsquo;He even thinks it
necessary to defend his acquaintances behind
their backs. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quel type admirable!</i>&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Why do you like Othmar, Prince?&rsquo; said
Geraldine, abruptly. &lsquo;I detest him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo; said Napraxine, in surprise.
&lsquo;You must be almost alone, then. What do
you see to dislike?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Geraldine glanced at his hostess, but she
refused to accept the challenge of his regard.
She was looking out to sea with a little dreamy
amused smile.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hate all financiers,&rsquo; said Geraldine,
moodily and lamely. &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La grande Juiverie</i> is
one gigantic nest of brigands; those men get
everything, whilst we lose even our old acres.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps that is your fault,&rsquo; said Prince
Platon; &lsquo;and Othmar, believe me, has nothing
to do with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Juiverie</i>; the Othmar are pure
Croats; Croats loathe Hebrews.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He is very fortunate, Prince, to have
your admiration and your confidence,&rsquo; said
Geraldine, with a sarcasm, lost on the pachydermatous
placidity of his host.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have always liked Othmar since one day,
of which I will tell you when we have more
time,&rsquo; answered Napraxine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Please tell us now,&rsquo; said his wife. &lsquo;I have
always been curious to know the affinity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
between you and Othmar. It is a walrus
gambling with a stag.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Am I the walrus? It is an awkward
animal,&rsquo; said her husband good-humouredly.
&lsquo;No, the tale can wait; he will be here in a
moment.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If he were an Admirable Crichton he
would be detestable, if only because he is so
hideously rich,&rsquo; interrupted Geraldine, with
sullenness, &lsquo;and the Princess has already spoken
of another defect, the greatest a man can have,
to my thinking; he is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poseur</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pshaw!&rsquo; said the Prince. &lsquo;How? What
do you mean? Othmar, I should say, never
thinks of himself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, he is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poseur</i>, certainly,&rsquo; said Geraldine,
with an undisguised cruel exultation in the
cruel epithet. &lsquo;He is a Cr&oelig;sus, and he poses
for simplicity; he is a financier, and he poses
as a grand-seigneur; he is gorged with gold,
and he poses as a Spartan on black broth.
The whole life of the man is affectation. His
humility is as detestable as his pride; his
liberalities are as offensive as his possessions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiens, tiens!</i>&rsquo; murmured Napraxine, taking
his cigar out of his mouth. &lsquo;My dear friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
you are under my roof, or at least on my
terrace, so I cannot quarrel with you. I can
only ask you kindly to remember what I said
a little while ago, and to spare me again
recalling to you that Othmar also is my friend.
You will understand.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Geraldine coloured slightly, conscious of
having been ill-bred, and muttered sullenly,
&lsquo;I beg your pardon.&rsquo; A more tart and stinging
retort was on his lips to the effect that the new
comer was the last man on earth whom his
host should welcome, but his awe of the
Princess Napraxine repressed it. She herself
gave her husband a glance of more appreciation
than she had ever cast on him, and said to
herself, &lsquo;The walrus is the clumsiest and the
stupidest of all living creatures, but it is so
honest&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; and said aloud:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Verify your quotations, was the advice
given by a dying don to an Oxford student.
Geraldine quoted from me, but he did not stay
to verify what he quoted. I spoke in haste.
Othmar is a tiny trifle of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poseur</i>, but it is
quite unconsciously; it is the consequence of
an anomalous position. All his instincts refuse
to be the Samuel Bernard of his generation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and he is equally horrified at the idea of
appearing as a Sidonia. If he had only ten
thousand francs a year to-morrow he would be
happy and charming. As it is, with his ten
millions or his ten hundred millions, there is
always the sense of that wall of ingots filling
up the background, and keeping, as he thinks,
the sunshine out of his life. Occasionally it
makes him see everything yellow, like the
jaundice, and to everybody else it makes him
seem a colossus, which is distressing to him,
as he is of ordinary stature.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He is even taller than I am,&rsquo; said her
husband.</p>

<p>Princess Napraxine, who had made her
little speech languidly, looking at the sea, and
extended full length on her Indian cane chair,
said with a little smile:</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear, I spoke metaphorically. I did
not mean to underrate your friend&rsquo;s centimètres.
I meant merely to explain that if he
do look occasionally a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poseur</i> it is the fault of
Europe, which, ever since he was born, has
persisted in worshipping him as one of the
incarnations of Mammon. If he had belonged
to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la grande Juiverie</i> he would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
much happier. Jews can swallow any amount
of flattery as they can wear any number of
rings. He likes neither.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Count Othmar,&rsquo; announced Grégor, ascending
the terrace steps from the gardens.</p>

<p>The person announced was a man of some
thirty years old, with delicate and handsome
features, and an expression at once gentle and
cold; his height was great, and his bearing
that of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand seigneur</i>. He looked weary
and dissatisfied; yet his life was one of the
most envied of Europe. He greeted Napraxine
with warmth, the Princess with grace and
ceremony; Geraldine and his sister with a
rather cold courtesy.</p>

<p>Nadine Napraxine had flushed a little as
he kissed her hand; a lovely faint flush which
made her cheeks like two pale-pink sea-shells.
Geraldine noticed that momentary change of
colour, and thought bitterly, &lsquo;She never looked
like that for <em>me</em>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Napraxine was not so observant; his hospitable
soul was filled with the pleasure of
welcoming his friend, and he felt angered with
his wife because she said so indifferently:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;I wonder you did not stay amongst the
Mongols, Othmar. They must be much more
original than we are. They ride all day long,
don&rsquo;t they, over deserts of grass? How enchanting!
I wonder you could tear yourself
away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps it would have been wiser to stay,&rsquo;
said Othmar, with a meaning which she alone
understood. &lsquo;But I fear &ldquo;the world holds us&rdquo;
too strongly for us to be long content even with
a Tartar mare and a fat sheep&rsquo;s tail. I am
fortunate to find you all here. I came from
Egypt; I saw your name in a newspaper, and
could not resist driving over to La Jacquemerille.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have your "Berenice"?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; she has behaved very well; we met
with a typhoon in the Indian Ocean, and were
nearly lost; but she has been patched up and
ran home bravely. I have left her at Marseilles
to be thoroughly overhauled.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will have to try her in a match with
Geraldine&rsquo;s "Zostera."&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I could not hope to compete with Count
Othmar,&rsquo; said Geraldine, sullenly; for him the
skies were overcast, the sun was clouded, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
pretty marble terrace with its gay awnings
seemed dark with the gloom of night.</p>

<p>He hated La Jacquemerille which he had
been so eager to persuade his friends to inhabit:
who could have told that this man would drop
on this Mediterranean shore without note of
warning, at a moment when he was supposed
to be safe on the sandy steppes of Mongolia?
&lsquo;As Count Othmar never, I believe, shot
anything in his life, I cannot perceive what possible
attraction any wild life can have for him,&rsquo;
he added now, in a tone that was aggressive
and impertinent.</p>

<p>Othmar glanced at him with a regard which
said much, as he replied simply: &lsquo;I have shot
the most noxious animal&mdash;man; I have never,
I confess, shot wood doves or tame pheasants.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Geraldine will shoot doves all the week,&rsquo;
said the Princess, with a sense that La Jacquemerille
had become interesting. She loved to
see men on the brink of a quarrel: sometimes
she restrained them from passing the brink;
sometimes she did not; sometimes she helped
them over it with a little imperceptible touch,
light as the touch of a feather, which yet had
all the power of electricity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;That is modern knighthood,&rsquo; said Othmar.
&lsquo;I prefer my Mongols.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My brother is English,&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth,
to avert disagreeable rejoinders; &lsquo;he
always reminds me of the old French caricature:
"It is a beautiful day; let us go and
kill something."&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Othmar is more English than Croat,&rsquo; said
Napraxine, &lsquo;but he does not kill things, he
prefers to paint them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Crésus doublé de Corôt</i>,&rsquo; murmured his
wife. &lsquo;Othmar, have you sketched any Mongol
ladies? are there such beings? or are they only
as that terrible Dumas has it, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la femelle de
l&rsquo;homme</i>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Only <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la femelle de l&rsquo;homme</i>, Madame. They
cannot be said to be women in any civilised
sense of that term; they only know the duties
of maternity, and are ignorant of the victories
of coquetry. You will perceive that they are
an entirely elementary animal.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Princess Nadine heard with a little smile;
she knew what allusions to herself were contained
in the words.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You should have married one of them,&rsquo;
she said, slowly moving her big fan. &lsquo;It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
have been too picturesque; the owner of two
hundred millions dwelling by choice under a
pole and a piece of blue cloth, and&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Cannot you forbear to quote my millions?&rsquo;
said Othmar. &lsquo;You would not reproach a
hunchback with his hump.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Though it is the only thing which makes
him noticeable,&rsquo; muttered Geraldine, but the
fear of his hostess made him speak too low to
be overheard save by Othmar, who did not
deign to notice the insolence.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You think money is not interesting,&rsquo; said
the Princess Nadine, &lsquo;but you are wrong.
It is the Haroun al Raschid of our day. It is
the wand of Mercury. It is the sunshine of
life. Only fancy, Othmar, if you chose you
could make the desert blossom like the rose;
you could call up a city like Paris in the centre
of your Mongolian steppes; that is very interesting
indeed. Money itself is not so, but
when one considers its enormous influence, its
fantastic powers, it is so; it is even more, it is
positively bewitching.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;When it comes out of anything so fairylike
and invisible as the Prince&rsquo;s salt-crystals it may
be,&rsquo; replied Othmar, &lsquo;but not when it is tainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
by commerce. Remember, Princess, your Mercury
was the god of the mart and of the
thieves.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That was in the Roman decadence.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And are we not in a decadence?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is the fashion to say so, but I am not
sure. Have we decayed? and, if we have, from
what? The last century contained nothing
noble.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Even the burning of Moscow belongs to
this,&rsquo; said Othmar, with a bow to Napraxine,
whose grandfather had been one of the foremost
generals at the defence of Moscow, and
one of the chief counsellors of that heroic
sacrifice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Othmar always remembers what is fine in
history and in his friends,&rsquo; said the Prince, well
pleased. &lsquo;He is not like Nadine there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, indeed,&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth; &lsquo;she
always likes to see that a great man is a little
one somewhere; she will always find out the
speck on the handsome rosy apple, the yellow
stain on the ivory, the rift in the lute&mdash;that is
her way. She would never have admired
Dr. Johnson, she would have only laughed at
his uncouthness and his dishes of tea, and only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
seen that he touched all the posts in the
streets.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I cannot help it if I am observant, and
Dr. Johnson certainly would have bored me,&rsquo;
said the Princess.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">&lsquo;Les délicats sont malheureux:</div>
  <div class="verse">Rien ne saurait les satisfaire,&rsquo;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>quoted Othmar.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then you and I are both profoundly
miserable,&rsquo; said Nadine Napraxine. &lsquo;I believe
we have never found anything that satisfied
either of us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Except, perhaps, each other,&rsquo; muttered
Geraldine, in a smothered voice, his jealousy
conquering his prudence. It was a phrase
which no one heard except his hostess, who was
as quick at hearing as Fine Ears. She did not
deign to take any notice of it; it could be
punished at her leisure.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What an idiot he is,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;as if
<em>that</em> tone could ever succeed with <em>me</em>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She had herself become amused, serene,
good-tempered, immediately, that with the
entrance of Othmar the twin masks of tragedy
and comedy had appeared to her prescient eyes
to lie upon the stage of the terrace of La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Jacquemerille. The whole place changed to
her: the view was beautiful, the house was
quaint and full of colour and variety, the orange
wood was a delightful bit of local colour, the
marble colonnade and the brown wooden balconies
were absurd certainly, but garlanded
about with all those sweet American creepers
they had a graceful effect; nowhere else in
December would you get roses and geraniums
and white marbles and blue waves, and a
thermometer at 20° Réaumur.</p>

<p>Othmar had brought that dramatic element
into her life without which, despite her really
very high intelligence, ennui was apt to descend
upon her. When his eyes encountered that look
they became very cold, and had a challenge
in them: the challenge of a man who defies a
woman to make him again the slave of her
caprices. Her husband saw nothing of those
glances. Geraldine saw more even than there
was to see, and became moody and dejected.
He only roused himself now and then to say
what he thought might be hostile or disagreeable
to the new comer. His remarks were ignored
by Othmar, which increased his irritation.
The Princess was amused, as she was, occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>ally,
at a good theatre, by the sullenness of the
one man and by the coldness of the other.
Both had elements, perhaps, of tragedy and
comedy. She felt a sudden exhilaration and
increase of interest, such as a person fond of a
theatre feels when the great actor of the hour
makes his entry on the scene. Geraldine was
very useful, she had known him several years:
he was always hopelessly in love with her,
timid, devoted, and obedient; but he had no
originality of character to make him very
interesting. He was extremely good-looking,
very popular, and very amiable, but he was
commonplace; he had not the wit of his sister.
She had admitted him into her intimacy because
he was humble, handsome, and usually so
docile that he seldom irritated her, but he
gave no interest to her life whatever; whereas
Othmar&mdash;she had scarcely ever confessed it
even to herself&mdash;but whilst Othmar had been
lost to sight in the wilds of Asia, society
had seemed to her even more stupid than
usual.</p>

<p>One had been in love with her for a year;
the other two years before had loved her.
There was a considerable difference in the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
passions, which she, with her analytical mind,
could perfectly appraise.</p>

<p>For the one she was quite sure of her sentiment
in return. He was good-looking, agreeable,
useful, submissive; he diverted her sometimes,
wearied her occasionally, obeyed her
always. She liked him, and liked better still
to tease him. The other had brought into her
life a sense of a stormier emotion than she
cared to raise. He had been more in earnest
than she chose to allow; he had loved her imperiously,
ardently, unreasonably; when she
had made light of it, he had left her with indignation
and scorn. He had been one of
those who had fought a duel about her, though
none but himself and his adversary had ever
known that she was the cause of it, a card at
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écarté</i> having served as the colourable pretext.
She had never been quite sure what she had
felt for him; admiration in a way, perhaps, but
more, she thought, dislike. But his had been
one of the conquests which had most flattered
her. When he had left all his habits and
friends and possessions to plunge into Asian
solitudes, she had felt that her power over him
was illimitable. And now he had returned
and told her, with as much chill assertion as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
regard could convey, that her power existed
no more for him. She did not care, but the
change interested her, and piqued her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor Othmar!&rsquo; she had said often to herself,
when remembering the passages which had
passed between them, and thinking of him in
Asia; and now he was back from Asia, and
sitting on her garden-terrace at La Jacquemerille,
and was telling her by manner and by
glance&mdash;perhaps telling her too persistently and
insistantly for it to be entirely true&mdash;that he
had vanquished his madness.</p>

<p>It had been a strong if short-lived madness,
born first in a country-house in the Ardennes,
in autumn-woods and tapestried galleries and
the stately revelries of a Legitimist party of
pleasure, fanned by her own will into flame in
the course of a brilliant, giddy, insensate winter
season in Paris. Then with spring had come
the decisive moment when he had declined to
be content any longer with his position, and he
had been lightly laughed at, disdainfully jested
with; and had revolted, and had gone out of
Europe after a duel which had made even her
tranquil pulses beat a little quickly in apprehension
of the possible issue.</p>

<p>With her usual consummate tact she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
so borne herself that the six or eight months&rsquo;
devotion, in which Othmar had been the shadow
of her every step, had attracted no injurious
notice from her husband or her world. It was
known that he was passionately attached to her,
but so many were so also, that beyond a little
more attention than usual, because he was a
more conspicuous person than most, the great
world of Paris only smiled and watched to see
if the snowflake melted. It did not melt, and
he went to Asia. The duel had only come
out of a trivial dispute at a club, so every
one believed, Prince Napraxine as innocently
as the rest.</p>

<p>It was after the departure of Othmar that
her society took to naming her the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flocon de
neige</i>. It seemed strange, both to men and
women, that Othmar should have been so near
her so long and have left no impression on her
life. He had usually a strong influence on
those whom he sought; in this instance he had
been the magnetised, not the magnetiser.</p>

<p>Men always quoted Princess Nadine to
their wives as an example to be followed for
the serene indifference with which she flirted
all the year through, yet never was compro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>mised
by a breath of calumny. Their wives
sometimes retorted that she had no heart, so
could not lose it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I promise you I will never be compromised,&rsquo;
she had said to her father a few months
after her marriage; and he, a very easy and
philosophic man of the world, had answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am sure you mean what you say; but
the test of your resolution will come whenever
you shall meet the person who pleases you.
At present you laugh at them all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not think I shall ever care,&rsquo; she had
said, with much accurate knowledge of herself.</p>

<p>Othmar, momentarily lava, had thrown himself
in vain against this indifference; the ice
of her temperament had not changed under the
volcanic fires of his. All those airy nothings,
that capricious friendship, that unrecompensed
position of servitude which she offered him, he
would have none of, and told her so with passion
and force.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And I will have no melodramatic passions
to disturb me,&rsquo; she had said. &lsquo;They are absurd.
They are out of date. They are tiresome.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Wounded and incensed, he had taken her
at her word more completely and instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
than she had intended; and she had not known
whether to feel regret or relief. She had felt
a good deal of triumph. And now he had
returned, unchanged in appearance, handsomer
even for that duskier hue which the desert sun
had left on the marble of his features; and she,
and he himself, were silently wondering&mdash;was
she glad?</p>

<p>He thought she was annoyed; Napraxine
thought so too; Geraldine alone, with a lover&rsquo;s
self-paining penetration, felt that life had
grown sweeter and more stimulating to her,
that her languid interest in existence had grown
quicker of pulse and more content with its
own atmosphere since her husband had read
aloud the name of Othmar on the pencilled
card.</p>

<p>Perhaps, thought he also, with a lover&rsquo;s self-torture,
what he had found in her of indifference,
of disdain, of lack of sympathy, had
been due to the absence of the sole person who
possessed the power to touch her dormant
emotions.</p>

<p>In reality, Madame Napraxine at that
moment felt no more than the vague expectation
and gratification of a spectator at a theatre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
who sees a drama complicate itself, mingled
with a certain sense of curiosity as to why
Othmar sought to display to her so conspicuously
his escape from her sorcery. She was
not mortified; she was accustomed to change
her adorers into her friends, and she was of a
nature too integrally proud to be capable of
small things. She only wondered&mdash;and doubted
a little.</p>

<p>Could any one who had loved her once fail
to love her all his life?</p>

</div>

<p>&lsquo;The &ldquo;Zostera&rdquo; looks tempting in the sunshine,&rsquo;
said Nadine Napraxine, as she rose and leaned
on the marble balustrade to gaze over the sea,
where the stately sailing yacht of Geraldine
was at anchor outside the little bay of La
Jacquemerille, which was too shallow to be
entered. &lsquo;I will go out in her in ten minutes&rsquo;
time. I prefer to watch the sunset from the
sea, and the sunset will be very fine to-day, for
there are a few clouds above; the sky is usually
so terribly monotonous here, it is like an eulogy
of your predecessor at the Academy: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il y a
trop de bleu</i>. Monsignore, I will take you
back to Nice by the coast. I dislike coasting
usually, but along this shore it is pretty, and
besides, it is too late to go far out to sea. Lord
Geraldine, go and give your men the order.
I will go and change my clothes.&mdash;Wilkes,
you will come?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Geraldine sullenly obeyed, and went down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the steps to where his long boat was still in
waiting. In a very few moments the Princess
Napraxine returned, not clothed in any maritime
fashion, for she thought that sort of thing
theatrical, foolish, and staring; but wearing a
dark serge gown, fitting with marvellous precision
to the perfect contour and lines of her
form, and carrying a scarlet parasol large enough
to shelter the dignity of any Chinese mandarin.
She wore yachting shoes and scarlet stockings;
her feet, like her hands, were such as sculptors
dream of but seldom see.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tell them to put in my furs,&rsquo; she said to
Geraldine. &lsquo;Are you ready? It is always so
cold here when the sun has gone down. We
will take Count Othmar and Monsignore Melville
to Nice. It is a beautiful day for a sail,
just wind enough and not too much. Platon
goes to his adored <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tripot</i>; I wonder he stayed
to eat his breakfast.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The &ldquo;Zostera,&rdquo; of course, is at your commands,&rsquo;
murmured Geraldine, with ill-disguised
ill-humour. &lsquo;For myself, if you will excuse
me, I will accompany the Prince.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She smiled, understanding his ill-humour
well enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;How immoral they are!&rsquo; she said to Melville.
&lsquo;The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle de jeu</i> by daylight is monstrous;
but since it is their form of happiness&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Happiness!&rsquo; muttered Geraldine between
his teeth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All your preaching and mine will not
alter them,&rsquo; she continued. &lsquo;It is an extraordinary
thing; neither Platon nor Lord
Geraldine cares a straw for money; neither of
them would awake a whit merrier if their
fortunes were quadrupled to-morrow; and yet
they find absolute intoxication in playing
for money! What an inexplicable anomaly!
Othmar is far more consistent. He despises
his own fortune and the table of M. Blanc
with equal sincerity.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not despise wealth, I dislike it,&rsquo; said
Othmar.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why should you do either?&rsquo; said Melville.
&lsquo;Look at the immense potentialities of great
riches.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is what I said this morning,&rsquo; continued
Princess Nadine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Surely great riches help one very nearly
to happiness,&rsquo; continued Melville. &lsquo;I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
mean from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeois</i> point of view, but
simply because they remove so many material
obstacles in the way of happiness. There
can be hardly any great difficulties for a very
rich man. He goes where he chooses, he can
purchase whatever he desires; there are swept
aside from his path for ever all the thousand
and one annoyances and hindrances which
beset the man who is not rich. Only imagine
a person who cannot reach his dying child
because he has not money enough for the
journey; imagine another who has his homestead
made intolerable to him by the erection
of a steam-mill, and yet is obliged to end his
days in it because he cannot afford to move;
imagine yet another with weak lungs, who
would recover his strength if he could take a
house in the country, in the south, and yet
cannot leave his business, which chains him to
a city in the north. Those are the sort of
sorrows from which wealth sets free a man or
a woman. One may say roughly, I think,
that if his health be good, a very rich person is
exempt from all other misfortunes than those
which come to him from his affections or his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
friendships; his troubles are, in a word, entirely
those of sentiment.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Precisely,&rsquo; said Nadine Napraxine.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&lsquo;Un seul être est mort et tout est dépeuplé!&rsquo;
</p>

<p>murmured Othmar; &lsquo;you will not allow, or
cannot comprehend that, Princess?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can imagine that a man might fancy so
for twenty-four hours; but even if the fancy
endure, a rich man can enjoy his desolation
while a poor man cannot. Part of the advantages
of the rich man consists in his having
the leisure and the luxury to muse upon his
own unhappiness. I think you forget what
a great happiness that is!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You believe neither in love nor in sorrow,&rsquo;
said Othmar, abruptly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am aware they exist, if you mean that,&rsquo;
she replied; &lsquo;but their existence chiefly depends
upon the imagination.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar gave an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And, like all pleasures of the imagination,&rsquo;
she added, &lsquo;require leisure for their development.
The rich man or woman enjoys that
leisure, and if he or she like to raise a gigantic
mushroom under glass, in the way of exag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>gerated
affections or sentimental regrets, they are
at liberty to do so. Besides, surely, no one can
deny that there is a captivating sense of power
in vast riches; the fancy can take endless flights
in that golden sphere; we do not know that
delight, because, though people think us rich,
in reality we are no such thing, in reality our
expenses keep for ever ahead of our income,
as I think they do with most people; but
Othmar, who is actually, positively, fabulously
rich, who is all alone, who spends nothing on
himself&mdash;at least, he used to spend nothing&mdash;why,
he could build you a cathedral, Monsignore
Melville, in every city of the world
of jasper and chalcedony, whatever they
are, and never be a sou the poorer for doing
it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you inclined, Count Othmar?&rsquo; said
Melville.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If it would make all men like you I
should be so,&rsquo; said Othmar. &lsquo;But I regret to
see that the Princess Napraxine has apparently
retained only one recollection of me, and that
one is of my &ldquo;wall of ingots,&rdquo; as she termed
it, which appears to separate me from her
sympathies.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Did you hear that?&rsquo; she said, not very
well pleased, though it was not in human
power to confuse her. &lsquo;We will let those
people go to Monte Carlo, and we will have a
run before the wind and leave you and Monsignore
at Nice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But it is not my own yacht.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But it is mine when I am in it, and I invite
you both. Come.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar hesitated till she gave him a little
look, one brief fleeting look. Two years seemed
to have fled away; he was again on the staircase
of the Grand Opéra, she gave him her fan
to carry, she had on a cloak of soft white
feathers, a gardenia dropped out of her bouquet,
he picked it up; in the whole glittering mass of
Paris he only saw that one delicate face, pale
as a narcissus, with two wonderful liquid eyes
like night; and, with a sort of shock, he recollected
himself, and realised that he was standing
on the terrace of La Jacquemerille beside a
woman whom he had vowed to put out of his
life for ever and aye.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come!&rsquo; said Princess Nadine, and he did
not resist her.</p>

<p>He followed in her shadow down the flight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of marble steps leading to the sea; while
Geraldine, with a tempestuous rage stifled in
his heart, drove Napraxine (who never drove
himself), as furiously as Russian horses can be
driven, along the sunny road, shaded with
olives and caruba trees, which led from La
Jacquemerille to the gambler&rsquo;s paradise a few
miles westward on the shore.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When boys sulk, they should always be
punished,&rsquo; thought the Princess Nadine with
silent diversion, as she heard the plunge and
rush of the horses on the other side of the
gardens, and divined that their driver was
already repenting of the moment of petulance
and of jealousy in which he had exiled himself
from her presence, and condemned himself to
the society of her lord.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor Platon is the dullest of companions,
and Geraldine thinks it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dans son rôle</i> to detest
him; and yet he goes with him by way of
showing his pique against Othmar. How
stupid, how intensely stupid!&rsquo; she thought,
with exceeding amusement to herself, as she
descended the water-stairs and stepped into
Geraldine&rsquo;s boat.</p>

<p>It was droll to her that anybody should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
either detest or envy her husband, he was so
infinitesimally little in her own life. She readily
did justice to his good humour, his loyalty, his
courage, and his honesty; but those qualities
were all obscured by his dulness and heaviness,
and also by the simple fact that he was her
husband, as the good points in a landscape are
blotted out by a fog. &lsquo;Dogs&rsquo; virtues! all of
them,&rsquo; she called them, with a mixture of
esteem and impatience, of appreciation and contempt.</p>

<p>The boat glided through a quarter of a mile
of blue water, and brought them to the side
of Geraldine&rsquo;s yacht, a beautiful racer-like
schooner with canvas white as foam, and flying
the pennon of Cowes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My poor &ldquo;Berenice&rdquo; was once as elegant
and spotless as this,&rsquo; said Othmar, &lsquo;but she has
been through sore stress of weather. Her sails
are rags, her sides are battered, her rudder is
gone. She made a sorry spectacle when we
hove to last night, but I am attached to her.
I shall not buy another yacht.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You always take things so seriously,&rsquo; said
Princess Nadine. &lsquo;A yacht is a toy like any
other; when one is broken get another. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
should you be attached to a thing of teak and
copper?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She has served me well,&rsquo; he said simply.
&lsquo;You do not understand attachment of any
kind, Princess.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is only an amiable form of prejudice.
Certainly I do not understand why you should
be attached to a thing made of wood and
metal.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Or to a thing made of flesh and blood! I
believe that is equally ridiculous in the eyes of
Madame Napraxine,&rsquo; said Othmar, with some
bitterness. &lsquo;May I ask, how are your children?&rsquo;
he added after a pause.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My two ugly little boys? Oh, quite well;
they are never anything else. They are as
strong as ponies. They are <em>very</em> ugly; they
have the Tartar face, which is the ugliest in
Europe; they are so like Platon that it is
quite absurd.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar was silent; the words did not seem
to him in her usual perfectly good taste. They
did not accord with the delicate narcissus-like
face of their speaker.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I remember that you never cared for your
children,&rsquo; he said, and added, after a pause,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
&lsquo;Nor for anything that had the misfortune to
love you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not think the children love me at all,&rsquo;
she said, with a smile. &lsquo;Why should they?
Their father they adore because he adores
them. It is always <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid pro quo</i> in any love.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not always,&rsquo; said Othmar, curtly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, you love me still,&rsquo; thought Princess
Nadine, without astonishment.</p>

<p>Aloud she said, &lsquo;It must be, or the thing
is absurd, it dies a natural death, or rather, is
starved to death; nothing one-sided has any
strength.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think you have seen many living proofs
to the contrary,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;But pride
may strangle a love which is not shared; it is
a violent death, but a sure one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why will men always talk of love?&rsquo; she
said, with some impatience. &lsquo;After all, how
little place it takes up in real life! ambition,
society, amusement, politics, money-making, a
hundred things, take up a hundredfold more
space.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is not to every one the unnecessary
molecule that it is to Madame Napraxine,&rsquo; said
Othmar. &lsquo;You have seen a glass of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
touched by a single drop of quinine? It is
only a drop, but it embitters the whole glassful.
So do the attachments of life embitter it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you put the drop in, no doubt,&rsquo; said
Princess Napraxine, drily.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Or if some one else put it in,&rsquo; muttered
Othmar, &lsquo;before one knows what one drinks.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! one must never let others meddle
with one, even in drinking a glass of water,&rsquo;
replied his tormentor. She knew very well
that he meant to reproach her, but she bore
the reproach lightly. If the remembrance of
her embittered any man&rsquo;s existence it was not
her fault; it was the fault of those who would
not be content with adoring her as the poor
people of this sea-shore adored their Madonna
shut away behind a glass case.</p>

<p>&lsquo;By the way, Othmar, have you not a villa
here?&rsquo; she said, suddenly remembering the fact.
&lsquo;I believe you have five hundred and fifty-five
houses altogether, have you not? Is there not
some place near Nice that belongs to you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;S. Pharamond? Yes. It is where I slept
last night. My father bought some olive and
pine wood and built the house in the midst of
them. It has a fine view seaward.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Then we shall be neighbours?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I do not go to Paris.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course you will go to Paris, but you
will go one day and come back another, like
everybody else at this season; though, to be
sure, I dare say you are longing for the smell of
the asphalte after a cycle of Cathay?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; the asphalte is not necessary to me.
It is more monotonous, on the whole, than the
desert.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! you were never a Parisien <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parisiennant</i>;
you were always in revolt against something
or another, though one never could
understand very well what. When you condescended
to our amusements, it was with the
air of a man who, to please a child, plays with
tin soldiers; that sort of air of contemptuous
condescension has made you many enemies.
There is nothing makes the world so angry
as indifference to what it thinks delightful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have offended it in that way yourself,
Princess.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Often; but not quite with your insolence.
A man who prefers his library to the clubs
is beyond all pardon; and, besides, I am seen
everywhere where it is worth while to be seen;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
you are&mdash;or were&mdash;generally conspicuous by
your absence.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I imagine the world has grown as indifferent
to me as I am to it, and having forgotten
has so forgiven me. I have been away
eighteen months.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The world never forgets its rich men, my
dear Othmar. It may forget its great ones.
Will forget them, indeed, unless they have a
drum beaten very loudly before them. You
might be great, I think, if you liked; you have
so many talents, so much power.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I might buy a kingdom the size of Morocco
or Montenegro? Very likely: such sovereignty
does not attract me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course I do not mean that: you do not
want to be a Prince Floristan; you do not love
the race of princes well enough. But were I
you I should set some great ambition before
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pardon me; you would do no such thing if
you were in my position. You would feel, as I
feel, the numbing influence of what you called
just now the &ldquo;blank wall of ingots.&rdquo; When
you can buy men you do not estimate them
highly enough either to serve or rule them. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
have all I can possibly want&mdash;materially. I
have no reason to seek anything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why do English nobles enter public life?
They want nothing, materially, either. Some of
them are of rank, also, so high in place that
nothing can be added to their position.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;God knows why they do,&rsquo; said Othmar,
&lsquo;except that I think the Englishman is an
animal like the beaver, not happy without work.
Besides, I think they imagine that they serve
their country, a delusion, but an honourable
one, which must make them very happy. As I
have no country I cannot be attached to it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You could choose one; you are allied to
several.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That would not be the same thing. To
adore the motherland one must have known
no arms, no hearts but hers; no country is more
than a stepmother to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are a very much envied man, Othmar,
but you are not a happy man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He looked her straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have been unhappy, but I have conquered
my folly. It is ingratitude to fate to
be wretched while one has health and strength
and no material cares to contend with.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;All the same, you are not happy now,&rsquo;
she thought, but she said, with her sweetest
smile, &lsquo;You admit that you have all you want
materially; all the rest is a dream, not worth
keeping awake about for one hour. By the
way, as you speak of countries&mdash;you are French
now by law, I think?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My grandfather was naturalised for his
own interests, as you know; but our people
were Croat peasants.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I know I have heard you always say
so; but I believe it is a fable. <em>You</em> do not
come from any peasantry; besides, surely Sclavonia
is old enough and dim enough to give
you any mystical heroic ancestry you may
prefer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They might be robbers,&rsquo; said Othmar, &lsquo;I
do not know. There is not much to choose.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Everybody who is noble comes from robbers
of some sort,&rsquo; said Princess Napraxine;
&lsquo;what were the Hohenstauffen, the Hohenzollern,
the Habsburg, the Grimaldi, the
Montefeltro, the Colonna? Robbers all, sitting
on high in their fortresses, and swooping down
like hawks on the fords, on the highways, on
the moorlands, on the forests, on the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
towns below them. You may be quite sure
that is what your people did in Croatia.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are very kind to try and console me,&rsquo;
said Othmar. &lsquo;Nobility, I think, consists in
being able to trace the past of your forefathers
and to have your charters; the past of mine is
lost in darkness, and my charters are lost with
them. Truthfully we can only date from 1767,
when Marc Othmar, who dealt in horses, began
to lend money in Agram. It is not a lofty beginning;
it is not even a creditable one. But
I do not think that to pretend that Marc
Othmar, the horse dealer or horse stealer, was
a hero and saint would mend matters. I
accept him as what he was, but I cannot be
proud of him; even sometimes I am on the
eve of cursing him; at all events, of wishing
he had never existed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear Othmar, you are very strange
sometimes&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Am I? One is never content with what
one has. There is nothing strange in that. If
you will deign to remember me at all, you will
remember that I was never pleased with being
the head of the house of Othmar; I would
give all its millions for an unblemished descent.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Then you are ungrateful to your fortunes,
and do not understand your own times.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I understand them too well, and
that is why I despise what they over-estimate.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And over-estimate yourself what they
have found worth but little. Look at most of
our contemporaries and associates. Have their
unblemished names served them in much?
How many have remembered that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse
oblige</i>? How many of them ally themselves
with the mud of the earth for the sake of
large dowries? how many mortgage their old
lands till they have not a sod left which they
can call their own? how many waste all their
energies and all their health in a routine of
miserable and stupid follies which are hardly
even to be dignified as vice?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She spoke with animation; her cheeks had
a faint flush, delicate as that of the waxen
bells of the begonia flowers, her eyes were full
of light. Othmar looked at her with a passion
of regret. If only she had loved him, he
thought he could have conquered the world,
have renewed the impossibilities of Alexander,
have done all that visionary boys dream of
doing as they read their Euripides or their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Æschylus in a summer noon under blossoming
lime trees.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will take from Rome what you yourself
have carried there,&rsquo; says a German writer,
and it is with love the same thing; you
take from it what you carry to it, you get out
of it so much spirituality, and no more, than
you bear thereto. To others Nadine Napraxine
was a coquette, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mondaine</i>, a mere <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élégante</i> of
the elegant world; but to him she was the
one woman of the earth; she could have inspired
him with any heroism, she could have
moved him to any sacrifice, she could have
compensated him for any loss; he saw in her
a million possibilities which no one ever saw,
which might be only the fruits of his imagination,
but yet were wholly real to him, unspeakably
lovely and attractive. She had offended him,
alienated him, treated his ardour and his
earnestness as a baby treats its toys, and his
reason condemned her inexorably and often;
yet she was the one woman on earth for him,
and he had tried to hate her, to drive her out
of his memory, and had thought that he succeeded,
and had only failed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you were like other men of your gene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>ration,&rsquo;
she pursued, &lsquo;you would be much more
content. You do not care for any of the
things which fill up their time. You have
magnificent horses, but you never race with
them, you never even hunt. You care nothing
for cards, or for any games of hazard. You
do not shoot except, as you justly observed, a
fellow-creature now and then when he provokes
you. You do not care to have yourself
talked about, which is the supreme felicity of
the age you live in; your solitary extravagance
is to have operas and concerts given in your
own houses with closed doors, like Ludwig of
Bavaria, and that seems rather an eccentricity
than an extravagance to the world at large.
You are a great student, but you care about
the contents of your books, not about the
binding or the date of their edition, so that
you never commit the follies of a bibliophile.
You do not care about any of your fine places;
you have an idea that you would like a cottage
just because you are tired of palaces. You
vex women by your indifference to their attractions,
and men by your indifference to their
pursuits. Because circumstance has made you
a conspicuous person with an electric light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
always upon you, you sigh to be an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">homme
d&rsquo;intérieur</i>, with no light on you at all except
that of your own hearth. It is Louis Seize
and the locksmith, Domitian and the cabbage-garden,
Honorius and the hens, over again.
History always repeats itself, and how one
wishes that it did not!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am flattered, Madame, that you deign to
draw my portrait, since it shows that you have
not wholly forgotten my features,&rsquo; said Othmar,
with some bitterness. &lsquo;At present I have not
discovered the hen, the cabbages, or the keys
that will make life worth living to me. No
doubt the fault lies with myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think you have not the dramatic instinct
which alone makes life interesting,&rsquo; replied
Nadine Napraxine. &lsquo;You do not divert yourself
with the faults, the follies, and the meannesses
of men; you sigh over them, and your
regret is so poignant that it prevents your
seeing how infinitely droll their blunders are
in reality.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;that there are
only two ways of looking on life which make
it interesting, or even endurable. The one is
the way of Corot, which adores Nature, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
can find an absolute ecstasy in the sound of
the wind and the play of the sunshine, and
asks nothing more of fate than a mill-stream
and a handful of green leaves. The other is
the way of Rochefoucauld and of St. Simon,
which finds infinite and unending diversion in
watching the feebleness and the mistakes of
human nature, which regards the world with
what I call the dramatic instinct, and amuses
itself endlessly with the attitudes and genuflections
of its courtiers, the false phrases and the
balked calculations. Now, though you are a
very clever man, my dear Othmar, you cannot
be put in either of these categories. You know
too much of the world for the first, and you
have too much softness of heart for the second.
Now, were you like Baron Fritz&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My uncle is the one perfectly happy man
that I have ever known,&rsquo; replied Othmar. &lsquo;It
is because he is the most perfect of egotists.
According to him the sun shines only for the
Othmar, as Joshua fancied it only shone for
the Israelites.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is not only that,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it is because
he has the dramatic instinct. He sees the
dramatic side to all that he does; suppliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
monarchs, bankrupt statesmen, intriguing diplomatists;
men who carry him schemes to tunnel
the earth from pole to pole, and great ladies
who want him to lend them money on their
family diamonds; they are all so many comedians
in the eyes of Baron Fritz. He pulls
their strings and makes them dance at his
pleasure. I quite understand how the whole
comedy amuses him so greatly that he can
never be conscious of a moment of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>. It
is a great pity that you are not like that. You
would leave such witty memoirs!&mdash;for you can
be witty,&mdash;or you would be if you were not
always so melancholy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I regret, Madame,&rsquo; said Othmar, &lsquo;that I
cannot alter the manner of my life even to have
the honour of amusing you after my death!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Across the bows of the &lsquo;Zostera&rsquo; at that
moment there passed, perilously near, one of the
lateen-sailed boats so common on the coast,
with their freights of fruits, of fish, of olives,
or of market produce. The boat was full of
lemons and of oranges, which gleamed like
virgin gold in the bright sunshine of the tranquil
afternoon. A peasant woman was managing
the sail, a young girl was steering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;What a beautiful face!&rsquo; said Nadine
Napraxine, who had a great love of beauty,
and the frank acknowledgment of it of a
woman high above all possibilities of envy.</p>

<p>Othmar looked where she pointed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A very lovely face,&rsquo; he said indifferently.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She does not look like a peasant,&rsquo; continued
Mme. Napraxine; &lsquo;that little grey gown
speaks of some convent. She steers well, for
they were terribly near. Who is that very
pretty child, Monsignore? I suppose you know
all the flock of which you are given the winter
shepherding.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pray do not make me responsible for
all the black sheep of these shores,&rsquo; said Melville,
drawing near and looking at the boat,
which was going slowly and heavily against
the wind, and labouring under a weighty load.
He said as he did so, with a little surprise:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, that is Yseulte de Valogne!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yseulte de Valogne! What a name of
the Romaunt de la Rose and black-letter
Chronicles! Pray who may she be, may I
ask?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They call her here Cendrillon,&rsquo; said Melville,
a little sadly. &lsquo;As for her name, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
de Valogne belong to French history; surely
you remember to have heard of some of them?
Aymar, who fell at the combat of the Thirty;
and Adhémar, who was Constable of France
under Louis XII.; and Maximin, who was a
general under Condé; and Gui, who was
ruined by his display at Versailles, a Colonel
of the Guard and a great officer of State. The
family is as historic as the Louvre itself, but
the poor child is literally <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans le sou</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;So that she is reduced to sell oranges?&rsquo;
said Nadine. &lsquo;How very touching! Othmar
will purchase immediately several bales.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, she does not sell oranges,&rsquo; said Melville,
&lsquo;but perhaps she is more to be pitied than
those who do. A great name and no dower&mdash;it
is to have silver bells to your shoes but no
stockings inside them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Surely she must have stockings, I mean
relations?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Only very distant ones. She is a far-off
cousin of your friend and neighbour the
Duchesse de Vannes, who brings her up; that
is, sends her to her convent, pays for her
frocks, and allows her to pass her holidays at
one of de Vannes&rsquo; country-houses. I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
know that we could reasonably expect the
Duchesse to do more, only there are two ways
of doing a thing, and she does not do this in
the best possible manner.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Cri-Cri cannot love a very pretty girl of
sixteen, it would not be in nature, certainly
not in her nature,&rsquo; said the Princess, with one
of her moments of frankness. &lsquo;I imagine they
will make her embrace the religious life; what
else can they do with her?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is what they will probably end with,&rsquo;
said Melville, with a tinge of sadness. &lsquo;It is
hard for a girl of noble blood and no dower to
end otherwise in France. The men who ought
to marry her, her equals, will marry instead
some Americans with dollars, whose fathers
were stokers or pork-butchers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But are there no other de Valogne?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;None; she is the last of a family which
was as extravagant as it was distinguished.
Othmar may have heard of her father, the last
Comte de Valogne; he was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viveur enragé</i>,
and finished the little that had been left by
Count Gui, the hero of Versailles, and the
fortune of his wife as well, who was a
De Creusac. She died in childbed. Her mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
had the care of the child, and he went on with
his life of pleasure until he broke his neck
riding at La Marche. The old Marquise de
Creusac, when she also died, could not leave
her granddaughter a farthing. The de Creusac
had been ruined in the Revolution, and the
sons of the Marquise, who would never have
anything to do with their brother-in-law, were
both killed in the war of &lsquo;70. There was no
one left but the Duchesse de Vannes, who was
a third cousin of de Valogne, to do anything.
She took the child in her charge, as I have
said, and has behaved admirably, in the letter
of charity, if something has been lacking of the
spirit. So long as the girl is being educated
the thing is easy; but when the time comes
when she must leave her convent, as she will
have to do in two years&rsquo; time, the problem will
not be so easy of solution; they will have
to decide on her future; at present her fate
has been easily settled, but soon the terrible
question will arise,&mdash;who will marry her without
a dower? I believe they mean to make
her enter the religious life, as you said; for the
men who probably would marry her for sake
of alliance with the de Vannes, will be those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
with whom the de Vannes would utterly refuse
to ally themselves.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A convent! Good heavens, for a child
like a Greuze picture!&rsquo; exclaimed Othmar.</p>

<p>Melville added sadly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is a refuge; but myself, I would never
have the religious life embraced only for its
safety. I never approve of looking at Deity as
a superior sort of chaperon. If all the soul
be not aspirant of its own accord to a spiritual
sacrifice the vows are a mere shibboleth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What soul shrined in a healthy body
would aspire to the cloister at sixteen?&rsquo;
thought Othmar, as the Princess said, &lsquo;All this
is very interesting, Monsignore, but it does not
explain how a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</i> of my neighbours, the
high and mighty de Vannes, comes to be rowing
in a boat full of oranges.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, that I cannot tell you,&rsquo; said Melville,
&lsquo;but I believe her foster-mother has a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bastide</i> near
Nice; it may be she is with her foster-mother
now. I knew her well when she was a little
child, living with the old Marquise de Creusac
in that extreme but refined and reserved
poverty of which only the old noblesse has the
secret. The Marquise was one of the sweetest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and most pious women I have ever had the
honour to know; but she could, if necessary,
have withered a king into the earth with a
glance. The child promised to be like her, but
had something <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouillante</i> and impetuous, which
had come to her from her father, and which,
beneath her high-bred manner and her chastened
tone, made her, as a baby, intensely interesting.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear Monsignore,&rsquo; said the Princess, with
a little impatience, &lsquo;surely you have mistaken
your vocation, and should have been a writer
of novels; you draw portraits with the skill of
Octave Feuillet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have only said what I have seen,&rsquo; said
Melville, good-humouredly. &lsquo;Probably Feuillet
only does the same.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boat with the oranges had passed
ahead towards the shore, its Venetian red side
was dipping in the trough of the waves, its old
striped sail was swaying in the wind; there
was a speck of gold in the sun where the
oranges were.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You had better rescue this distressed
damsel and marry her, Othmar!&rsquo; said the
Princess Napraxine, with an unkind little laugh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
&lsquo;She seems made on purpose for you. She has
the unsullied descent which you are always
sighing for, and you certainly can dispense with
a <em>dot</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>For answer he only looked at her; but she
understood his answer.</p>

<p>Melville vaguely understood also that in his
innocent praises of his Cinderella he had unwittingly
struck a false chord, and he was too
much a man of the world not to be grieved
at his involuntary failure in tact. The boat
meanwhile was fast growing to a mere speck
of red and yellow colour, soon to be wholly
lost in the blue radiance of sea and sky.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have at times bought some Greuzes,
if I remember,&rsquo; continued the Princess. &lsquo;They
are pretty, soft, conventional, but I do not
know that your gallery is much the richer for
them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They belong to another time than ours,&rsquo;
said Othmar. &lsquo;I imagine Talleyrand was right
when he said that no one born since &lsquo;89 can
know how sweet human life can become.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And how elegant human manners can be,&rsquo;
added Melville. &lsquo;Cendrillon has something of
that old grace; when she was two years old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
she curtseyed as though she were Sevigné&rsquo;s
self.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a paragon!&rsquo; said Madame Napraxine.
&lsquo;Poverty and all the Graces! An
irresistible combination. The time I should
have liked to live in would have been Louis
Treize&rsquo;s; what perfect costume, what picturesque
wars, what admirable architecture!
Is this child at Sacré C&oelig;ur, did you say, Monsignore?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That would be too extravagant for her
place as Cendrillon,&rsquo; replied Melville. &lsquo;No; I
think they were wise not to put her amidst all
those great ladies in embryo; she has been
educated by the Dames de Ste. Anne, at a
remote village called Faiël in the Morbihan.
She has had a pale girlhood there, like the
arum-lily that blossoms under the moss-grown
oaks.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How poetic you are!&rsquo; said the Princess
Napraxine, with a smile which brought a flush
of embarrassment even to the world-bronzed
cheek of Melville. &lsquo;Men are so much more
romantic than women. Here are Clotilde de
Vannes and I, who only see that, as this young
girl has no dower, the very best place for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
in the world is a convent, melancholy but inevitable;
whereas you and Othmar, merely
because she has pretty hair which the sun
shines on as she goes past amongst her oranges,
are already thinking that some one ought to
rise out of the sea to marry her, with a duke&rsquo;s
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couronne</i> in one hand and a veil of old d&rsquo;Alençon
lace in the other! Certainly those things
do happen. If she were an impudent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écuyère</i>
at Hengler&rsquo;s, or a Californian who never had a
grandfather, the duke&rsquo;s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couronne</i> would no
doubt appear on her horizon. By the way,
pending her eternal retreat, does Cri-Cri allow
her to be seen at all?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will probably see her at Millo. I saw
her there last week, and made her cry by
reminding her of her babyhood on the isle;
and of her grandmother, whom she adored.
She is with the Duchesse now, because there is
typhus fever at the convent, and the pupils are
all dispersed; but Millo is scarcely a congenial
air for a poor relation, who is also a proud
one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! she is a good advertisement of
Cri-Cri&rsquo;s virtues, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">elle en a besoin</i>,&rsquo; said the
Princess Napraxine, with her merciless little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
laugh. &lsquo;And de Vannes, what does he say to
so pretty a relative?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A man like de Vannes never sees that a
young girl of that type exists.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hum&mdash;m&mdash;mph!&rsquo; she murmured dubiously.
&lsquo;That depends on a great many circumstances.
Propinquity and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i> will make
Ste. Scholastique herself sought like the Krauss
or Jeanne Granier. Millo is certainly a very
odd kind of home for your woodland arum-lily.
If she have any intelligence at all, and relate
what she sees when she gets back to Faiël, the
good Dames de Ste. Anne will have the monastic
enjoyment of scandal gratified to the
uttermost.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I believe she lives entirely in the schoolroom
whilst at Millo,&rsquo; said Melville, a little
impatiently. He wished he had never spoken
the name of Yseulte de Valogne, the name
which seemed to belong to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le temps quand la
Reine Berthe fila</i>. He had one of those instincts
of having spoken unwisely, one of those
presentiments of impending disaster, which
come to finely organised and much-experienced
minds, and are called by blunter and slower
brains mere nervous nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>When the other day the tall factory chimney
fell at Bradford, the birds which built in it
had flown away before the workmen&mdash;stupidly
eating their breakfasts till the bricks tumbled
about their ears&mdash;had looked up and seen any
danger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p>As Othmar leaned against the side of the yacht
and let his eyes dwell on her face, unseen by
him so long, his regard let something of the
emotion which he felt escape him, and betrayed
that the chill indifference with which he had
met her again had been but the mere mask of
pride, though it might be a mask which he
would be strong enough always to wear in her
presence.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yonder is S. Pharamond,&rsquo; he said, conscious
of his momentary loss of self-control, as
he pointed to some round towers which rose
above woods of ilex trees and magnolias. &lsquo;If
you would allow them to land me there instead
of at Nice I should be grateful, and perhaps
you would honour me with landing too: the
house is somewhat neglected, as I have been
away so long; but they will be at least able to
give you a cup of tea.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;With pleasure, if Wilkes likes it,&rsquo; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Princess, as she joined her friend. &lsquo;I never
knew you had a place upon this coast; surely
you never named it when&mdash;when I knew you
first?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Most likely not,&rsquo; said Othmar, &lsquo;I have
been seldom there. It was a favourite house
of my father&rsquo;s in his rare moments of leisure,
but I have never cared for the air or for the
world of Nice. I have lent it sometimes to my
friends.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you not lend to your friends?
In that respect you have made yourself honey,
and the flies have eaten you without hesitation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If the honey be not in the hive it ought
to be eaten. There is a landing-place in my
grounds, and the house is not more than a
quarter of a mile distant, if such a distance do
not alarm you. I know that you are no great
pedestrian, Princess.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why should one be when there are so
many more agreeable modes of progression?
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On ne doit jamais se punir pour rien.</i>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have walked twenty miles for my own
pleasure very often,&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth, who
approached them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, but you are English; we were just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
saying that all English people are like beavers,
you must be sawing and drilling and building
and dragging something or other all through
the length of your days. I could walk, I
think I could walk right across Russia, if
there were any wise object to be obtained by
it, but simply to walk, as a mad dog runs, from
a sort of blind impulsion!&mdash;no, that is beyond
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are such a curious union, Nadine, of
languor and energy, of indifference and of
potentialities,&rsquo; began her friend.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My energy is latent,&rsquo; she said, interrupting
her. &lsquo;I do not waste it on every-day trifles,
as you waste yours. You always use forty-horse
power to boil an egg or make a box
of wax matches. That is an English idea of
energy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your grandmother, the Princesse d&rsquo;Yssingeaux,
was English by birth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;So was Othmar&rsquo;s mother. That is why
he and I have something of the beaver in us,
but calmed, controlled, kept in reserve; we
do not waste our time and timber damming
up threads of water, but we shall be ready if
an inundation occur.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Othmar, perhaps,&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have a great deal more energy than he,&rsquo;
said Nadine Napraxine, with a smile, as she
leaned back in the wicker lounging-chair,
looking as indolent as a Turkish woman, and as
delicate and useless as a painted butterfly.</p>

<p>The schooner in twenty minutes&rsquo; time
landed them at a creek, with a little marble
quay, shadowed by great pines and eucalyptus
trees; there was a pavilion on the small
pier, a pretty kiosque all white and blue and
gold, with twisted pillars and Moorish arabesques.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Remember, nothing here is of my taste or
choice,&rsquo; said Othmar; &lsquo;I have not been at the
place for ten years. Would you like to rest?
They can bring your tea to you; or would
you come up to the house at once?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Va pour le château</i>,&rsquo; said Nadine Napraxine;
&lsquo;I never care for the preface of a
story.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I fear you will find it a dull story,&rsquo;
said he, as they left the quay and passed up
a steep path, always under the shadow of the
trees.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a misfortune for him that he in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>herited
so much! It prevents him enjoying any
thing,&rsquo; she said to Melville; who replied, a
little drily:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not think it is what he inherited
which prevents his enjoyment, Princess; it is
more probably what he encountered and sighed
for vainly. Life holds many of these ironies.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I were he,&rsquo; she continued, ignoring the
reply, &lsquo;I should care for nothing but that power
which he, in common with other great capitalists,
possesses. To be able to make a war
possible or impossible by the mere inclining of
your wand of gold&mdash;that must be the most
interesting of all possible kinds of influence.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, the financier is the modern Merlin,
but then there is Vivien&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;In Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s poem, not out of it,&rsquo;
said Princess Nadine, sceptically; but she knew
very well that Vivien was then walking under
the shade of her own great red parasol, with its
group of humming-birds embroidered on its
left side.</p>

<p>The pathway ascended steeply through the
woods, bordered with datura and geranium,
which were still blossoming gaily; here and
there was a wooden bench, a majolica seat, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
little statue; the ground was of shining shingle;
it had been kept in perfect order, awaiting its
owner, for ten years. After about a quarter of
a mile it ended on a level space of the red rock
up which it had climbed. Here had been laid
out a fairy-like and fantastic garden, lawns,
palms, fountains, walls of shrubs, and groves
of camellias and azaleas, spreading before a
château, which was, in architecture, a miniature
Maintenon, and in position stood high enough
to look over the sea in front of it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a delicious place!&rsquo; said Nadine;
&lsquo;and in a month or two, when all those
azaleas flower&mdash;if I had known you had
owned such a bijou, I would have told you to
lend it to us. It makes La Jacquemerille a
mere trumpery toy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I would lend you nothing,&rsquo; said Othmar,
in her ear; &lsquo;I would have given you everything&mdash;once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he added aloud, &lsquo;This is somewhat
trumpery also, I fear; modern things are so
apt to have that look. They are like the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">articles de Paris</i>, which cost enormously, but
are only plush and ormolu after all. However,
Viollet le Duc built this house; so it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
be a little better than its neighbours. Only I
should like statelier and simpler gardens myself;
I should like high box hedges and old-fashioned
plants. But I suppose they would
not go with the Mediterranean.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You like anything simple and homely;
you will have to marry Margot, or Ph&oelig;be, or
Grethel, off a farm,&rsquo; said the Princess, with
some contempt. She was a hothouse flower
herself, and despised thyme and dog-roses.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I might do worse,&rsquo; said Othmar, as he
ushered them into the house, which contained
some wonderful china, some admirable modern
pictures, some fine statuary, and more French
luxury than its master cared to have surround
him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is exquisite,&rsquo; said the Princess, after
wandering through it, and returning to a room
opening on the gardens; a room hung with
tawny plush, embroidered with white roses and
blue irises. The chairs and couches matched
the walls, a gilt cornice ran round the oval
ceiling, which was painted <em>in tempera</em> with the
story of Undine. &lsquo;How many more houses
have you, Othmar, standing like so many open
empty caskets waiting for you to put the jewel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of life into them? Really, how many have
you? Come, tell me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have too many,&rsquo; said Othmar. &lsquo;But
excess always carries its own retribution;
amongst them all I have no home; none that
I feel home-like. I can imagine what it is&mdash;a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chez soi</i> that one cares about and desires to
return to&mdash;but I do not possess it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Make it,&rsquo; said Melville; &lsquo;that is always in
the power of every man who is not a priest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose it is,&rsquo; said Othmar. &lsquo;But it
has never seemed very easy to me. The fire of
the hearth is like the coal from the altar: it
comes from heaven, and can scarcely be commanded.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He glanced as he spoke at Nadine Napraxine,
who was lying back against the golden gleams
of the plush of her couch; she had a tea-rose
in her hand which she had plucked from the
gardens. She looked dream-like and ethereal.
She had on her lips that little smile which
meant so much and yet said nothing, and was
half compassion and half disdain, and partially,
also, amusement. If she had been mistress
here and in all his other houses, he thought,
each one of them would have been Eden to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
him. But that had not been Melville&rsquo;s meaning.</p>

<p>At that moment his servants brought in the
tea noiselessly and quickly: little Saxe cups,
frosted cakes, forced strawberries, appearing
on great old plateaux of gold,&mdash;as though he
had been served there every day instead of
having been absent ten years.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Really, Othmar, you have a little of the
Haroun Alraschid, though you do not care for
your throne,&rsquo; said Melville: &lsquo;who would have
imagined that returning from Asia last night
you would have tea all ready made for your
friends?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My friends reconcile me to my house,&rsquo; said
Othmar; &lsquo;you will leave almost a perfume of
home behind you, these rooms will seem lonely
no more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The rooms are quite perfect,&rsquo; said Princess
Nadine, &lsquo;but still I think we will have our tea
out of doors; the sun is still brilliant. We
have now and then little fits of rurality; when
we have those we sit on a terrace and take tea;
that is as near rusticity as we care to go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She walked through one of the doorways
into the air as she spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>To Othmar the golden-coloured room with
its white roses and blue irises seemed to grow
dark as she left it.</p>

<p>As she passed out to the gardens his people
brought him a note; it was inside a silver-grey
envelope, with a silver <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couronne</i> upon it, and
on a silver-grey card was written a very pressingly
worded invitation to dinner the following
night with his neighbours the Duc and Duchesse
de Vannes. They had just heard of his arrival;
they would have a few people; they begged
him not to be formal, &amp;c. &amp;c. The château
nearest to him was Millo, their favourite winter
retreat; a gorgeous and fantastic place, with
many a gilded cupola and shining dome which
caught the sunshine from the sea, amidst groves
of magnolia and woods of ilex. He had not
been to Millo for ten years. When he had
been last there the Duc had been just married
to a famous beauty, and he had known them
very well in Paris ever since that time. They
were not people for whom he cared much:
Alain de Vannes was a sporting man, and his
wife was one of the leaders of fashion, with
half a hundred lovers given to her, rightly
or wrongly, by report. They were, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
legitimist in politics to the backbone. Neither
of their families had ever pandered to Emperor
or Elysée, and they were, despite their easy
morals and their profound indifference to each
other, exceedingly exclusive, and, with all their
nonchalance, even arrogant.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It must be a strange house for that
poor little girl,&rsquo; he thought as he threw the
card aside, and remembered the Greuze face in
the Venetian red boat. Millo was not more
than a mile off him, at one point their woods
and his joined, and looking from his terrace
any day he could see the gilded minarets and
the varicoloured tiles of their villas shining in
the light against billows of dark evergreen
foliage.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How soon they know you are here!&rsquo; said
Nadine Napraxine, as he spoke of the invitation
to her. &lsquo;You will go, of course; you cannot
have any engagements?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will you be there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not know; yes, perhaps. I never
make up my mind until the last hour. People
say it is cruel when they have dinners; it
leaves a place blank; but how can you be sure
what you wish to do until the moment comes?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
I detest dinners. When we have really become
civilised we shall each of us eat in solitude, or,
at the least, each behind his own screen. Why
should one of the unloveliest of the operations
of nature be performed in public? The
flowers, and the plate, and the footmen cannot
really embellish it; indeed, they only make it
the more grotesque.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How droll you are, Nadine!&rsquo; said Lady
Brancepeth. &lsquo;You have certainly a monopoly
of singular ideas.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish my ideas were general,&rsquo; answered
the Princess. &lsquo;When the world has really
refined itself it will look on our eating in
society as we look now on savages eating with
their fingers. Some of our friends cannot even
have a little love affair but they must go and
eat prawns, and quails, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits fours</i> together
in a café; and if a hero comes home from
a war anywhere his countrymen at once make
him eat and drink in public by way of showing
their respect for him. The whole thing is
absurd. The only creature that is not offensive
when it eats is a bird. Just one little dive in
a rose, or under a vine-leaf, and it has breakfasted.
But we!&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;When a very pretty woman eats a strawberry,
the bird is not very much her superior,&rsquo;
murmured Melville.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Reverend father,&rsquo; said the Princess, &lsquo;you
have no business to know whether one is pretty
or not. Fruit, perhaps, does keep something
of the golden age about it; but our dinners!&mdash;were
I a man I would never see the woman I
admired taking her share of diseased livers,
tortured fish, slaughtered songsters. They are
fond of writing nowadays about a higher
humanity which will succeed to ours; but my
idea of it would be that it should be fed like
Fénelon&rsquo;s islanders by only breathing sweet
odours. That would be even better than the
bird&rsquo;s dip in the rose.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then you will not go to Millo?&rsquo; persisted
Othmar.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who knows what one may do in twenty-four
hours?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The servants had carried the gold trays
out into the garden after her. Melville and
Lady Brancepeth, who were more comfortable
in the embrace of their plush couches, returned
within-doors; Othmar drew his chair nearer to
hers, and offered her a cigarette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Rurality always wants this consolation,
Princess,&rsquo; he said, as he did so.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thanks; not till I have finished my strawberries.
They are delicious. How do you
manage your households? If we go home
unexpectedly anywhere we always find the
servants away, the major-domo drunk, the
house topsy-turvy, and not a thing to eat
within twenty miles. How did you keep them
at this point of perfection?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They are never sure that I may not
arrive at any moment. If servants be not
ready at any hour of the day or night they
are not worth their salt. Then I have very
faithful stewards&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;One marvel does not explain another.
The fidelity is perhaps more astonishing than
the perpetual readiness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I reward fidelity; most people limit themselves
to accepting it. If you do not pay your
servant well he will help himself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am sure we pay&mdash;pay endlessly. Platon
spends Heaven knows what on the servants,
but he gets only a mob of rogues, who rob
him right and left.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have no right to suppose the Prince less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
wise than myself; but perhaps there is other
payment as well as money in which he does
not deal. I let the humblest man in my
service have plenty of hope; there is no moral
tonic so bracing; each of them knows that he
may rise if he only deserve it. Then, again,
I am heedful to have my house-stewards men
of high character; a house-steward is one&rsquo;s
viceroy&mdash;one cannot be too careful in choosing
him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I should never have supposed you cared
about those things, Othmar,&rsquo; she said, in much
surprise, as she stared at him, a strawberry
held uneaten against her lips.</p>

<p>&lsquo;One must think about them or be at war
with one&rsquo;s conscience,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;That
is the tedium of life; its duties are so inexorable
and so wearisome.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is an easy conscience absolutely necessary
to you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; I could easily imagine circumstances
under which a guilty one would make me
carry it lightly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A gleam of the old passionate emotion
which she had once known in him passed for a
moment into his eyes with gloom and fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
mingled. He repressed it; he did not wish
her to believe that she had still the power over
his life which she actually possessed. He heard
her voice saying always, &lsquo;I will have no melodramatic
passions to disturb me; they are
absurd, they are out of date, they are tiresome.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And she had said it out of no virtue, only
out of sheer shallowness and indifference.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is a very shocking sentiment,&rsquo; she
said demurely now, as she ate another strawberry.
&lsquo;At least, one is bound to say so;
Monsignore in there would certainly say so.
Indeed, from Monsignore&rsquo;s point of view, one
would certainly think it so; but as all we
modern people, whatever church we ostensibly
belong to, are all so completely of one mind
that we know we are only automata, made up
of nerve-centres and different gases, I do not
see why we should necessarily have consciences
at all, do you? Why should we have one any
more than the zostera from which I named
that yacht?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Only because the zosteræ have no traditions
of a conscience, all men have.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All men? Savages have not, primitive
races have not; and how should we know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
whether the zostera has or has not? She may
have a very perfect system of ethics, sitting on
her rocks in reach of the tide&mdash;I should think,
indeed, she had a sort of Buddhism.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You named that yacht?&rsquo; he said abruptly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; Geraldine had her built last year.
He is not like you; he has not a superstition
that one is bound to go on sailing in the same
ship all one&rsquo;s life, however old-fashioned she
may grow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lord Geraldine has many superiorities over
me. He has the patience to play at Platonic
cicisbeism as children play for counters,&rsquo; said
Othmar, with a brusque contempt.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is neither a well-bred speech nor a
true one,&rsquo; said Nadine Napraxine very calmly,
as she set down her cup.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Its breeding I cannot defend, its truth I
do,&rsquo; he answered coldly. &lsquo;There are men who
can spend their lives carrying a woman&rsquo;s fan,
and ask for nothing more at her hands; they
have merits, no doubt, but they are not those
which I appreciate.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor Ralph! if he heard you!&rsquo; she said,
with a little yawn which she could not control,
though she tried to stifle it with a cigarette.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
&lsquo;He thinks himself far more manly than you
because he shoots fur and feather, and you do
not kill anything&mdash;except a man now and
then!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I may yet add to the list of the latter,&rsquo;
said Othmar.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Mongolians have made you very
savage,&rsquo; she said, as she lighted the cigarette.
&lsquo;And you used to be so gentle.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I used to be many things that I have
ceased to be since the twentieth of April a year
and eight months ago,&rsquo; said Othmar.</p>

<p>She had forgotten the date which he remembered
so accurately, the date of the day
on which they had parted in her own room in
Paris, with the smell of the lilac of the avenue
coming in through the open windows, and the
sunset rays, as they came through the rose-coloured
blinds, touching her fair face, and the
curl of her long dark lashes, and the beautiful
mouth with the little cruel languid smile on it
as she had said, &lsquo;I will have no melodramatic
passions to disturb me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him now with the demure
un-selfconsciousness of a child.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! I never could remember dates,&rsquo; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
murmured. &lsquo;I was the despair of all my
governesses, I had such a bad memory.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is convenient sometimes,&rsquo; said Othmar,
a little bitterly. Why were all those past hours
written on his remembrance as the chisel writes
on stone, whilst she had shaken off their
memories as a bird shakes a summer rain off
its wings?</p>

<p>&lsquo;And how,&rsquo; he added with an effort, &lsquo;with
such a defective brain as you describe, have
you become one of the most cultured women
of Europe? Does forgetfulness of&mdash;dates&mdash;enhance
the power of acquiring other knowledge?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think it leaves the brain freer,&rsquo; she
answered, in that serene way which she had
with her when she was intending that a man
should never forget her whatever she might
choose to forget.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; he said impatiently. &lsquo;No
doubt learned women have never been very
tender ones.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Learned! what a terrific word. Would
you call a mere poor frivolous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mondaine</i> like
me by the same word that described Lady Jane
Grey and Mrs. Somerville? I know a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
languages; I had <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnes</i> of every nation when
I was a baby; and I have read Schopenhauer
and Herbert Spencer, and I assure you that one
bored me as much as the other. But learned!
would a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bas bleu</i> eat your strawberries or smoke
your cigarettes?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Or take all my heart and my soul out of
me?&rsquo; he thought, as he answered, &lsquo;No; certainly
your one great science, Madame, was
never learned either in the nursery, or out of
Schopenhauer and Herbert Spencer. It is the
perfection of high art; and you, like all supreme
artists, cannot pause to remember what your
studies may cost to your subjects.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She did not ask him what art or science
he meant; she lighted a second cigarette and
said, in her sweetest voice, &lsquo;I do not think you
are quite so even-tempered as you used to be,
Count Othmar. Look, the sun is low; it is time
to be going homeward. What are Monsignore
and Evelyn doing? Will you call them,
please?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stay yet a little while; I have not seen
you for so long,&rsquo; he murmured, ashamed and
irritated at his own weakness in letting the
words escape him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Naturally you have not,&rsquo; she said, with a
gay laugh, &lsquo;since you have been in Asia and I
in Europe. Why did you go to Asia? People
do not do that sort of thing nowadays. If they
be annoyed they walk down to their club and
play hard, or they ride a horse at a steeplechase,
and in a week they think no more about
it. And why did you have that duel with de
Sénélac? It was very imprudent. I had told
you I could not bear that kind of melodrama.
Nobody knew certainly, but that was only
because they were all stupid; any one might
have known. And Sénélac never left his
bed for six months; and have you heard that
he will limp, they say, for ever?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar, with a gesture, intimated that the
misfortune of his late adversary was a matter
of utter indifference.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you be sorry that he limps,&rsquo; he said
impatiently, &lsquo;be sorry that you gave him your
bouquet to carry. Princess, you are very fond
of psychological studies, but you do not like
to be reminded of what others pay for them.
You know well enough what men suffer for
you, and through you, but you do not choose
ever to blame yourself for making them do so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
The world has not changed; the mode of expression
may have altered, but men feel as
they felt in the days of David or of Æschylus.
Love is what it was then, a mere passing
pleasure or pain to many, but to some the
herald of heaven or of hell, the begetter of
heroism or of crime.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear Othmar, pray excuse me,&rsquo; said
Nadine Napraxine, &lsquo;you talk beautifully, you
always did, but I cannot stay to hear you when
the sun is just going down, and we have only
a yacht that crawls to take us home to dinner.
It is my fault that it crawls: he would have
had a steam one if I had not prevented him. I
detest smoke and machinery, but still certainly
without them one crawls. Monsignore, will you
come if you have finished talking about the
Little Sisters of the Poor?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar&rsquo;s face grew cold, a sombre displeasure
darkened his eyes, he drew back and
let Melville join Madame Napraxine. He himself
walked beside her friend down the path
through the woods talking, but not sensible of
what he said, watching the red sunshade with
its embroidered humming-birds pass before
him under the boughs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>As they neared the quay he took from the
hands of one of his men two bouquets of
gardenias and orchids, and offered them to
the two ladies; they were in pretty cornucopiæ
of silvered wicker-work. Any one would
have thought that there had been the preparation
of a week for this afternoon visit.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon prince</i>,&rsquo; said Madame Napraxine
as she took her orchids, &lsquo;why will
you pretend to be a barbarian? The little
graceful amenities of the world become you,
and you do them so well, though you do them
so seldom; why will you make yourself <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un
homme de foyer&mdash;manqué</i>? It is much nicer,&rsquo;
she added in a low murmur, &lsquo;to give me a
bouquet than to shoot another man for carrying
one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He did not answer. Her jests jarred on
him.</p>

<p>When they reached the quay the sun was
setting, the boat was waiting, the sailors immovable,
their oars held straight in the air.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Adieu, Othmar!&rsquo; said the Princess Nadine
gaily. &lsquo;Your château is marvellous, your orchids
are exquisite, and your tea was enchanting;
we will leave you all alone in your poetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
solitude, and when you want prose and society
you will come to La Jacquemerille.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will you not honour me again?&rsquo; he said,
angry at his own weakness. &lsquo;Would you not
dine with me to-morrow night? Or the day after
to-morrow? I think the Prince would come.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! Platon would come certainly,&rsquo; said
Nadine Napraxine, with a smile; &lsquo;you are his
especial friend. He shall come to you alone;
then you can talk to him as much as you like
about the burning of Moscow and&mdash;and&mdash;all
those other dates for which you have so
admirable a memory!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She would say no more than that, and
her musical slight laugh tantalised his ear as
the boat was pushed off in the deep blue water,
and the seamen bent above their oars.</p>

<p>Otho Othmar leaned against the marble
balustrade and watched them row away towards
the schooner, with an anger in which
vain regrets and baffled desires were mingled
disconsolately. He remained there till the sun
was gone down, and the white canvas of the
yacht had passed out of sight round a bend of
the shore.</p>

<p>When he retraced his steps to his solitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
house, he saw a tea-rose lying beside the gilded
garden chair which she had occupied as she ate
her strawberries. It was the one which she
had gathered and dropped. He picked it up
and put it in his coat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quand on aime on n&rsquo;a que vingt ans</i>,&rsquo; he
thought with scorn for himself.</p>

<p>He entered the golden drawing-room, wrote
a formal note of invitation to the Prince and
Princess Napraxine, and said to one of his
servants, &lsquo;Send a messenger over with this
letter the first thing in the morning to the villa
that is called La Jacquemerille.&rsquo; Yet he had
come from Asia with the firm resolve to show
the Princess Napraxine that he had conquered
all passion for her; and he was not on the
whole a weak man.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p>He dined alone; a few telegrams would have
filled his rooms, but he did not care for society,
which he thought only came to him because
he was one of the few owners of milliards in
Europe. He sat alone after dinner in the
salon which she had admired, with the light
of half a hundred wax candles bringing out
the golden gleams in the plush, the colours
of the embroidered irises, the dead gold of the
cornice and panels, while a fire of olive wood
glowed under the carvings of the mantelpiece
of porphyry. The plush curtains, with the lace
beneath them, veiled the shuttered windows;
outside the night was calm, there was no sound
anywhere. The words of Melville came back to
him as he sat there in the midst of the luxury
and of the loneliness: &lsquo;To make a home is in
the power of any man who is not a priest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It did not seem to him to lie in his.
He could have bought a principality, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
could not buy a home. Love alone could
create that, and the only woman he had loved
for years was Nadine Napraxine.</p>

<p>If she had been what he wished to him,
would she have made him this ideal home&mdash;she,
capricious, indifferent, disdainful, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mondaine</i>,
as she had said, in every habit, thought, and
attitude of her life? Perhaps not; probably
not, he knew; yet she alone would have had
power to make a melody out of the discords
of his desires and his discontent; she alone
seemed to him to fill the vacant places, to
smile across the solitary room, to have left the
lingering perfume of her presence there, as the
orange flowers left their fragrance in the cabinet
in which they were laid for a moment.</p>

<p>Otho Othmar was one of the richest men
in Europe; he was often disposed to regret it,
as many persons regret that to which they have
been born. He did not think it a thing to be
vain of; he was even occasionally ashamed of
it. It seemed to him that when you were so
much richer than most of your fellows you
were required to be very much better than
they; and it is not always agreeable, nor often
easy, to be so. When he signed &lsquo;Othmar&rsquo; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
was as when an emperor signs his name, and
with a stroke of the pen he could give away
millions with as much ease as lesser mortals
can scatter pence. This facility was no pleasure
to him. Though he was well aware that riches
are the one ruling power of the modern world,
and comprise in themselves the wishing cap and
the magician&rsquo;s wand, Excalibur and Holy Grail,
he did not greatly prize his possession of them;
perhaps because they had been always before
him and about him in profusion from his birth.</p>

<p>The Othmar fortune had been steadily
growing for a century and a half. At the
commencement Marc Othmar, a Croat, native
of Agram, had been a poor man enough&mdash;a
horse dealer, some said a horse stealer&mdash;what
precisely never was known. Agram is not a
very greatly frequented place, and records get
easily mildewed and dim in it. Whether he
began life as pedlar, or peasant, or, as some
affirmed, as a robber of wild colts, Marc Othmar
at forty years old was a money-lender, commission
agent, and banker, and at sixty had
become a millionaire, known of far beyond
Croatia, and had laid the foundations of one of
the great financial houses of Eastern Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>His son quadrupled his possessions and
extended his operations westward and northward.
His grandson fell upon the hard times
of the Napoleonic wars as on a bed of roses;
and from the misfortunes of Austria and Prussia,
and the necessities of Pitt&rsquo;s England, made
gold as rapidly as though he had had the
philosopher&rsquo;s stone in a crucible. He grew
into a very colossus of riches, and his houses
did their business in Vienna, Paris, London,
and Frankfort. He married the daughter of
a French duke, and made his central house
of business in Paris.</p>

<p>His eldest son Stefan, who inherited all
his astuteness, succeeded him in due course in
the direction of affairs, ably seconded by his
brother Friederich, and in his turn married the
daughter of an English nobleman, by whom he
had one son, Otho, who was chiefly educated
in England, and who had little or nothing of
the Othmar type in feature or in character.</p>

<p>He was a boy of infinite promise, and of
no ordinary mind, but, despite his personal and
intellectual gifts, he was a bitter disappointment
to his father; and the indifference, which
at times deepened into contempt, with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the lad reviewed the origin and the employment
of the fortunes of his house seemed
to him nothing short of blasphemy. Stefan
Othmar himself was a man of excessive arrogance,
but it was a bourgeois arrogance, proud
of its own sources and dominion, and capable
of infinite self-abasement in the pursuit of self-interest.
That his boy should revolt against
his descent and despise the future before him
was a fact so hideous and so amazing in his
sight that, had he not known his dead wife to
have been the purest and coldest of women,
he would almost have doubted that his own
blood ran in the veins of his degenerate heir.</p>

<p>As Otho grew towards manhood the distance
between them widened more and more. That a
fastidious fine gentleman, a fantastic and futile
dreamer, a mere visionary and dilettante, should
be the outcome of a hundred and fifty years
of financial success and ambition seemed to
Count Stefan so frightful a mockery of fortune,
that he cursed his own folly in having wedded
a patrician, instead of some woman of a common
but ambitious stock who would have given him
successors content, and solely content, with
the superb position of princes of finance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
capable of doubling and quadrupling those
many millions which were his own ecstasy. The
very virtues of his son alarmed him as hardly
any vices would have done. The youth was
so delicate of mind and taste, so devout and
chaste of habit, so meditative and so solitary
by choice, that his father grew alarmed lest he
should actually do what he at times threatened,
and consecrate himself to the Catholic priesthood.
He took a violent remedy.</p>

<p>He went to one of the most seductive and
most venal women of the day, and said to her,
&lsquo;Win this boy from his dreams or he will
become a monk.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She undertook the mission, and succeeded
in it. She destroyed all that was spiritual and
innocent in him with the merciless witchery of
the courtesan, which is like the tide of burning
lava: no grass will spring where the scoria
has spread. He awoke in her arms without a
faith. He never again dreamed of the religious
life. She earned well the estate in Franche-Comté
and the large sum in rouleaux which his
father settled on her; but nothing in after-life
could ever give him back those heavenward
aspirations, that purity of soul, which she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
swept away as with a wave of fire. Like the
young Reichstadt before him, he had wasted
all the splendour and innocence of a first
passion on a wanton who had betrayed him
for gold. The first passion of a boy colours all
his future; the bitter-sweet flavour of this
remained with him through all his later years.
Love without it was tasteless; love with it was
worthless. He said once to his father: &lsquo;You
had better have killed me than have given me
to Sara Vernon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who passes by the gates of disillusion has
died twice.&rsquo; His father had pushed him with a
hard hand through those gates, believing that
they led to the path of self-knowledge and of
empire over men. Stefan Othmar had not
wanted a poet, a scholar, a philanthropist, or a
priest for his successor; he had wanted a cold-hearted,
clear-headed, unscrupulous, unyielding
financier to hold, and even to increase,
the mighty powers and possessions of which
the name of Othmar was a symbol to the
world.</p>

<p>But the crime he had committed did not
obtain for him what he desired. The merciless
cynicism with which he had destroyed the faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and the purity of his son did not ensure its
object. The youth remained as aloof in mind
from the traditions of his house, and as disdainful
in spirit of them, as he had been before.
He consented, indeed, with apathy, to put his
signature to the deeds which made him one of
the chiefs of the house, but that was all which
Stefan Othmar gained by his son&rsquo;s immeasurable
loss. Some four years later, when Otho was
two-and-twenty years of age, Stefan Othmar
died suddenly on the steps of his great hotel
in the Boulevard St. Germain, as he was ascending
them after an audience at the Tuileries, in
which he had been the master of the situation,
and Napoléon Trois the suppliant. He died
of fulminant apoplexy without an instant&rsquo;s
warning; but his affairs were left in the most
perfect order. His brother Fritz remained,
who had been his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alter ego</i> all his life, and
nothing was altered in the House of Othmar,
of which his son became supreme master.</p>

<p>The young man received the news far away
in the forest recesses of Lahore, at the court of
an Indian prince, where he was being feasted
with royal honours in the course of his travels
over the world. There had been no sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
between his father and himself; their temperaments
had been as opposite as the poles; little
sentiment of personal affection mingled with his
sudden consciousness that he was absolute
lord of his own destinies. His first impulse
was to use the power into which he had entered
to destroy, at a blow, all that his forefathers
had been a century and a half in building up
for him. &lsquo;It is a mass of corruption; it shall
perish,&rsquo; he said to himself, with the ruthless
integrity, the unsparing fanaticism, of a generous
and high-souled youth. But when he returned
to England and came face to face with all his
responsibilities and powers, he found that which
he had thought so easy was quite impossible to
accomplish as he desired to accomplish it. His
first impulse was to throw the whole into
liquidation and efface the House of Othmar
from financial existence for ever. But to do so
was but a dream; the financial world would
not have released him from his obligations;
his only living relative, his father&rsquo;s brother and
partner, Baron Friederich Othmar, stoutly refused
to suffer that to be done which would, in
his sight, have been a greater crime than many
murders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Against his desires and against his conscience,
he had, on reaching his majority, been
half persuaded, half coerced, by his father to
associate himself in legal form with the house.
The act had been one of filial sacrifice, and it
hung like a wallet of stones about his neck.
He found that his power had its limits; that he
could no more disengage himself from all the
operations and engagements of his firm than a
young king can emancipate himself from the
trammels of court and constitution. He had
a right to ruin himself, but he had no right to
ruin all those whose fortunes were interwoven
with the enterprises of his predecessors. Irritated
and disappointed he resigned himself to
the inevitable, and remained the &lsquo;master of
milliards,&rsquo; with as much regret as the young
Francis Joseph accepted the diadem of Austria.
The cloth of gold in which they, his forefathers,
had wrapped him remained upon him,
and sometimes he thought it a very shirt of
Nessus.</p>

<p>Sometimes he was almost tempted to take
the vow of poverty for the sake of getting rid
of it, but he was restrained by two recollections&mdash;one
that he had no spiritual faith, the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that mankind in general would have voted him
insane. A profound melancholy, without any
definite or special cause, grew upon him; he
felt the sense of an immense responsibility,
which he saw no manner of using with proportionate
usefulness. The sophism that duties
unsought may be disregarded did not satisfy
his conscience, whilst his knowledge of the
world told him that to do harm is as easy as to
kiss your hand, whilst to effect any great good
is as hard as to move the mountains from their
bases. Public charity only fills the pockets of
greedy speculators; private charity too often
raises up a festering mass of imposture. The
rich man goes through the world as a sheep
through briars in spring time. If he be a
perfect egotist, he is happy enough; if he have
thought and feeling, he is depressed by the universal
greed around him, and by the absolute
impotence of all religions to bridle it.</p>

<p>Otho Othmar remained always sensible of
a bitter irritation and degradation whenever
he recalled the sources of the wealth he enjoyed:
the ruin of prosperous countries, the
wholesale slaughter of wars, the distress or
disgrace of ancient nobilities, the impoverish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>ment
of nations. True, there was another
side to the throne of Plutus, on which his
fathers had seated themselves; by their means,
no doubt, enterprises had been carried out
for which humanity, on the whole, was materially,
if not spiritually, the better. Canals,
deserts, mines, cities, colonies, ocean ways, had
felt the vivifying powers of the great Othmar
loans; but the evil appeared to him far to out-balance
the good, and all the wealth seemed to
him tainted. He had considerable pride, in a
shape with which men would not have sympathised.
He fancied that the inherited nobility
of his French and English blood was always at
war with the blood of the Croat bankers by
whom he had been begotten. Though his position
was one which almost all the world envied,
it was one which galled himself. Titles had
been offered him, but he had contemptuously
rejected them. He was Othmar; the name
spoke to all the ears of Europe; he did not
consider that the story it told could be either
changed or buried by smothering it underneath
the blaze of some princeship or dukedom. He
did not even call himself, as others called him,
Count Othmar, and he put neither coronet or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
escutcheon on his carriages, his plate, or his
writing-paper. He was far too proud to be
proud in that way.</p>

<p>Illustrious alliances had been proposed to
him, but he had rejected all; the world expected
him to marry greatly, but he remained
the hope and the despair of all the European
nobilities, who would have willingly accorded
him any one of their fair virgins. Their eagerness
had early given him a cynical disdain for
the aristocracies to which his tastes attracted
him; he had no less a disdain for the financial
order to which tradition allied him. On the
whole, although he had never had any especial
sorrow, he was scarcely a happy man, though
the whole world was ready to gratify and
amuse him. He had been always able to indulge
his fancies to the uttermost, but all the
venal beauty which affected adoration for him
left his heart cold.</p>

<p>Though gentle in manner and chary of
speech, he could on provocation say caustic
truths which cut like surgeons&rsquo; knives. In
general, however, he was indulgent to follies
which he did not share. He lived always a
little apart from the world in which he was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
conspicuous a figure, and he judged it with
good nature rather than with sympathy.</p>

<p>Occasionally, as Nadine Napraxine had said,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il voyait en jaune</i>; the bitterness of spirit which
comes over all who see themselves sought for
what they possess passed over him also, but its
pessimism never lasted long. That human
nature was trivial but not evil was, on the
whole, the result of his experiences.</p>

<p>By one of the odd caprices in which destiny
delights, a lettered ease would have been the
utmost he would have cared to command.
The incessant demands which a great fortune
always brings upon its possessor were to him irksome;
wherever he went mankind pursued him
hat in hand and hand outstretched. He could
arrive nowhere without petitions and invitations
raining in on him; obscurity was not to be
enjoyed even in Mongolia, where the Foreign
Ministers at the Chinese Court and the Celestial
Emperor himself sent mounted messengers
after him to see that he came to no harm.
The interest everywhere excited by his arrival
or by his actions irritated him perpetually; the
impossibility of securing privacy, to him formed
the gravest of annoyances. His intolerance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
publicity made him almost detest the whole
human race which combined to refuse it to
him. To be compelled to live in a glass-house
appeared to him to destroy the very first requisite
for life&rsquo;s enjoyment. He concealed this
sensitiveness under a chilliness of manner which
did injustice to the real warmth of his sympathies.
There was much that was at once
attractive and irritating to women in this
young man whose fortunes were so immense
and power so extended, who yet passed through
the world with so unaffected an indifference to
his own advantages in it, and who had the
melancholy and romantic features of a Ruy
Blas or of a Rolla. With men, his perfect
simplicity of expression, his unpretentious
courage, and his unfailing generosity, commanded
respect, whilst his position excited
their envy; but while he compelled their esteem,
he did not, as a rule, possess their attachment.
&lsquo;If we are in a position to serve men
greatly, we shall never be greatly loved by
them,&rsquo; said Melville to him once; &lsquo;we shall
make too many ingrates, even though we do
our best not to make one. Men, as a rule,
love most what they can afford a little to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
despise and have no cause whatever to envy.
Do you remember when the anarchists of &lsquo;48
came to old Rothschild at Ferrières and demanded
his fortune for the people of France,
and he very quietly took up his pen and made
aloud his calculation that his fortune divided
thus would give everyone just four francs and
a half each? Well, the fault of the very rich
man to the world is always Rothschild&rsquo;s to the
anarchists; everyone expects he can bestow
on each of them ten millions, whilst he can
only really give four francs and a half. The
calculation may be as clear as day, but the fact
is one never forgiven.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar understood that very well with his
reason, but he was not reconciled to it in his
heart; he would have desired something different.
The immense hotel which his father had
built, with its ceilings painted by Ingres and
Delaroche, its gardens sloping to the Seine, its
genuine treasures of art, its double staircase, its
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cour d&rsquo;honneur</i>, its stables built on the model
of Chantilly, was no better than a barn to him;
he detested it with a sort of petulance; he
never willingly resided in it. Its network of
communication with the banks and the bu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>reaux,
laid with all the facilities which modern
science could invent, had no interest for him.
He did not feel the slightest emotion about
any public event that could possibly happen,
whether wars and rumours of wars, or the
betting of a racecourse. He had none of
those tastes which may make a rich man
popular for a season and ruined in a twelvemonth.
To his mistresses he was invariably
generous, but these extravagances scarcely
made more impression on his vast fortune than
a few pailsfull taken from the sea make diminution
in its volume. His greatest pleasure, on
which he spent his money most largely, was
music. Wherever he was he gathered great
singers and musicians around him. She had
likened him to Ludwig of Bavaria. His caprices
were not quite so eccentric, but his preference
was almost as ungrudgingly indulged.
He had studied music theoretically and profoundly,
though he had never touched any instrument
and had never written a bar. It was
one of those tastes which to his father had
appeared an absolute insanity. He also spent
much upon his libraries and his horses, as
the Princess Napraxine had said to him. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
since he was not a bibliophile, and did not
care for rare editions, and never raced or made
wagers, his expenditure even here was moderate
as compared with his powers. From the time
of his early and bitter passion for Sara Vernon
he had avoided those famous sorceresses who
can beggar Cr&oelig;sus and discrown Cæsar; they
recalled too vividly to him the intense suffering
of his boyhood, when he had found himself
betrayed by what he adored. To the few
women whom he had ever noticed he had been
invariably generous even to excess, with a
generosity that strove to make amends for the
scorn he had for them; but he had had none
of those long-enduring <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liaisons</i> which cling like
the octopus and drain like the vampire. The
knowledge that so many women would have
drunk the dregs of infamy at his word for the
sake of his gold, held him aloof from them;
he was conscious that they pursued him as the
sword-fish pursues the fish entangled in a seine.
There was no Venusburg which would not have
let him enter into its enchantment with his
golden key; and this untempted Tannhäuser
turned away indifferent. All the rest which
attracted other men&mdash;gambling, feasting, drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>ing,
racing, living together in feverish crowds,&mdash;appeared
to him ridiculous and tiresome.
All the popular vices of men of his rank
seemed to him dull and vulgar, trivial and
stupid; the life of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">muscadin</i>, of the masher,
seemed to him, on the whole, more stupid than
the Tartar&rsquo;s. There was a certain similarity
between him and Nadine Napraxine. The
world appeared to them both very narrow and
its resources few.</p>

<p>For her the result of this impression took
the shape of disdain; in him of regret.</p>

<p>In her it was a thirst of the mind, in him
it was a hunger of the heart, which led them
to think that the land around them was barren.</p>

<p>His friends called him jestingly as Chateaubriand
was called, &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le grand ennuyé</i>,&rsquo; but it
was precisely his vague discontent with the
puerilities and the vulgarities of existence which
made his affinity to Nadine Napraxine. She
had much the same contempt for all those who
surrounded her and who made so much of all
their little ambitions, who crowned themselves
with straw and thought they reigned, who set
their souls on a winning horse, a political
measure, a policy, a project, or a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d&rsquo;état</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
whilst the horse was to her taste as much worth
wasting thought on as the statesmanship.</p>

<p>If he had heard of his own total ruin he
would have put a Horace in his pocket and
walked out of the great bronze Renaissance
gates of his palace with a serenity which would
have had in it nothing either strained or affected.
He was no ascetic or philosopher,
but his great fortunes bored him, and their
origin annoyed him. His temperament would
probably have led to higher ambitions if he
had not been born to so much possession that
ambition had no scope. He was wont to cite as
the wisest man the world had known the gay
physician of the Fronde epoch, Gui Patin, who
sat throughout that troublous time, peaceful
and amused, beneath his own cherry-trees. But
fate had seated him, himself, beneath the gold
pagoda-tree, and the tree seemed to him a
sterile one; it had neither fragrance nor shade,
yet a million eager hands were always trying
to pluck from it, and for him who sat under
it there was no quiet. Some one was
always wanting him to shake down the fruit
into their hands.</p>

<p>He had had one great misfortune; he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
known satiety almost before he had known
enjoyment; and men were so bent upon making
use of him that they did not take time to
attach him to them before they disgusted him.
The world in general did not like him much;
it followed him endlessly, but it thought his
reserve arrogance, his simplicity of taste affectation,
and his dislike to display avarice. It
did not comprehend in the least the simple
truth that Othmar would have shaken his gold
off him if he could have done so like so much
mud. In the Croat character there are both
romance and religion; he had more of the
Croat than the English temper in him; but,
like most men of his time, he had no belief at
all, though it was a sorrow to him, not a boast;
and the romance of his impulses had been early
chilled and silenced by the venal passions
offered to his boyhood for sake of his wealth. He
learned too early that there is scarcely anything
which may not be bought. It is a knowledge
which hardens the selfish, but saddens the generous,
nature. The irresistible conviction that
money is after all the one great power of the
world is not an exhilarating or a consoling fact
for thoughtful or visionary minds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>He knew very well that he might have
been the most vicious brute, the most brutal
tyrant, the most merciless of men, and mankind
would have served, followed, and flattered him
none the less; he could have purchased immunity
for most crimes, condonation for most
iniquities. So long as he had remained master
of his fortune and of his possessions, he knew
that men would have sought him none the less
eagerly though he had had the vices of a
Heliogabalus; and that women would have
given themselves to him none the less willingly
though he had been as hideous as the Veiled
Prophet. It did not make him cynical; but it
made him indifferent, and it moved him at
times to a vague sadness. It seemed scarcely
worth while for his forefathers to have raised
that mountain of gold, only that from its summit
he might see the nakedness of the world of
men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock on the following night Othmar
walked across his gardens, under a starlit sky,
towards the adjacent grounds of Millo. A few
roods of plantation parted his from theirs; in
the boundary fence there was a small gate, of
which his major-domo had reminded him that a
key existed. The night was young, but the stars
already were many, and a slender moon had
risen in the deep serene blue of the heavens.
Though it was midwinter the air was sweet
with the smell of orange orchards in flower
and of the aromatic pine-woods of his own
enclosures.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will she be there?&rsquo; he thought a hundred
times.</p>

<p>He had kept away from her all the day, had
busied himself with his sailors, with his steward,
with the condition of the place; but he longed
to see that smile which even in its malice was
sweeter to him than all the kindness of others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to hear again that voice which was music to
his ear, even in its chill, indifferent mockeries.</p>

<p>He had an intuitive belief, which had been
shaken but not destroyed by his own failure,
that in her nature there were depths to be
reached, passions to be awakened, though a
bland and cruel indifference at present veiled
them. He had been ruthlessly betrayed by
her coquetry, profoundly wounded by her coldness,
but he believed in her still&mdash;even still
believed in himself as the man whom ultimately
she would love. He had returned to
Europe with the resolution never to be in her
presence except when the hazards of society
should bring them perforce in the same atmosphere,
but at the first charm of her regard
he had forgotten all his resolves, lost all his
wisdom. Life only seemed worth living if he
could hear that one voice, so sweet in its
modulations, so chilly in its perfect harmony.
It was, perhaps, because he was one of the few
men who could gratify all wishes, caprices, and
ambitions as fast as such arose, that this one
thing wholly denied to him, wholly inaccessible,
had such force of attraction for him. Yet
he was bitterly angered against himself for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
own submission. She was but a supreme
coquette, a woman <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pétrie du monde</i>, despite all
her charm; but she could make her careless
little nod, or a half-ironical smile, more prized
from her than the utmost tenderness of other
women ever was. There was about her that
air as of one so wholly indifferent to all the
vulgarities which others esteem triumphs that,
when she ever deigned to notice that a man
existed, he was more flattered than by the
fondest concessions of his most ardent adorers.
She had been assailed by all the powers and
vanities of passion, but she had always given
it at most that cool little smile&mdash;sometimes the
smile had been compassionate, more often it
had been cruel. Women had succumbed to
him as full-blown roses fall before the touch of
a careless hand; for this reason the chillness
of Nadine Napraxine, which seemed chastity,
had had so strong an attraction for him that for
awhile it had seemed to him sweeter to wait
upon its caprices than to obtain fuller response
from them. But no man tarries long at this
stage of his affections, and the time had come
when he had grown impatient of a pursuit
without end, of an allegiance without recom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>pense.
It was like an empty cup of exquisite
form and transparent beauty, for ever without
wine in it; to the connoisseur the gem is perfect
thus, but to those athirst it brings little
delight.</p>

<p>The unshuttered windows of Millo were
glistening with light, which shone through the
thickets of rose-laurel and bay as he approached
the house, and a flood of light was poured
out shining on the stone <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perron</i>, carpeted and
screened closely by rose-coloured awnings from
the air of night. After a year and a half spent
on tropic seas and in desert lands, the return to
society has always a half-sweet, half-bitter,
flavour. Was it worth while, he thought, to
leave all the routine and tedium and emptiness
of the world only to drift back again into its
formalities and follies?</p>

<p>He had, however, no choice left in the matter,
for the servants in the antechamber were
bowing low to him and taking his furred coat
from him, and in another moment the Duchesse
de Vannes was welcoming him with all the
genuine pleasure which a hostess feels in having
the first visit from a person long absent, and
high enough in the world&rsquo;s favour to make his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
return to the world an event of social interest
and of public importance.</p>

<p>Aurore de Vannes, called Cri-Cri by her
friends, was a very pretty woman, as much
and as delicately painted as the fan she carried;
she wore a marvellous costume of cream-coloured
velvet blent with japonica-coloured
satin, and had japonicas in her hair and at her
bosom; she wore also some very fine rubies.</p>

<p>When he entered the drawing-rooms of
Millo there were a dozen persons assembled
there, most of whom he knew, but amongst
them was not the Princess Napraxine. There
was lamentation for her absence, but no surprise
at it, because her caprices were so well
known.</p>

<p>As he entered a little note had entered
behind him; when Mme. de Vannes had said
all her pretty greetings to him she glanced at it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Désolée&mdash;migraine&mdash;temps
détestable,&rdquo;&rsquo; she murmured, as she ran her eyes over it.
&lsquo;Of course!&rsquo; she said, aloud, &lsquo;that is always
Nadine&rsquo;s way&mdash;she does it on purpose. She loves to
disappoint people. She was out riding this afternoon; I saw her in the
distance with Boris Seliedoff. She treated the Empress in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
that fashion last winter at Petersburg, and when the Dames du Palais
told her that the Tsarina was so displeased that she would exclude her
from Court, Nadine said to them quite simply: "Trop de bonté! Je
m&rsquo;habitue si mal à ces corvées-là."&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And has she been excluded?&rsquo; asked one
of the guests.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ouf!&rsquo; cried the Duchesse de Vannes, &lsquo;I
see you do not know her. No empress in the
world would dare to exclude her. Imagine
how she would avenge herself! Courts cannot
afford to be brave nowadays.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar heard every syllable she said as he
conversed with De Vannes, a tall man of some
eight-and-thirty years old, with a look of extreme
distinction and of as supreme fatigue.
&lsquo;Who is Boris Seliedoff?&rsquo; he thought, with the
restless jealousy of an unsatisfied passion. He
regretted his tent in Tartary: the elegant rooms,
the perfumed air, the pretty women, the low
buzz of conversation, the little breaks of
laughter, the artificiality, the monotony of the
whole thing, wearied him already.</p>

<p>The dinner was gay and even brilliant; to
him alone it seemed tedious. Why had she not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
come? he thought, and that disappointment
alone occupied him. He was angered that she
should have so much power to make <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la pluie
et le beau temps</i> of his time and of his moods.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is Othmar cured by Central Asia?&rsquo; said
one of the guests to the Duchesse de Vannes
who looked across the table at him, and
answered, &lsquo;I should say not. He would hardly
be within five leagues of La Jacquemerille if
he were so. Besides, Nadine has a power of
making herself remembered which I have seen
in no one else. It is because she remembers
nothing herself. The law of contrasts is the
law of affinity.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Madame Napraxine is the only woman in
whom virtue does not look ridiculous,&rsquo; said an
old gentleman to his neighbour, overhearing
her name. &lsquo;But then, true, this is because it
is not virtue at all, but something much more
disdainful and unapproachable. Have you
seen a peacock ravage a flower-garden? He
does not care for any one of the flowers, but
all the same the carnations and roses and
geraniums fall in showers as he goes, strewing
them right and left, and drawing his plumes
carelessly over the waste he has made behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
him. Her lovers are no more to Madame
Napraxine than the flowers to the peacock; but
the result is the same.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is that a quality you would rank very
highly?&rsquo; asked the person next him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That depends on your standard,&rsquo; he
answered. &lsquo;It is a power which is to her just
what plumage is to the peacock&mdash;something
quite beyond imitation, and royal in its disdainful
beauty. I did not think men were ever
hopelessly in love in this century, but with her
I perceive that they are so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Othmar&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash; began the other.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Othmar?&rsquo; repeated the old diplomat,
&lsquo;Othmar reminds me of a man I once knew,
who was a collector of miniatures; the collection
has been dispersed now by unworthy
heirs, but some twenty years ago it was a
marvel of completeness. Every admirable miniaturist
whom the world has possessed was represented
in it by his finest examples. It had
taken him thirty-five years and more millions
to make it what it was. Any one else would
have thought it perfect. He did not, because
he had not an example amongst it of Karl
Huth. You may never have heard of Karl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Huth; I never had. He was a German miniaturist
of the sixteenth century; he dwelt at
Daunenberg, a small place on the Elbe. There
is nothing of him in any museum, and there
was supposed to be nothing of him anywhere
but his tradition. For thirty-five years my
friend hunted North and South Germany for
a Karl Huth. At length, such was his perseverance
that he did find an undeniable Karl
Huth, in the family of a tradesman at Grieffenhagen,
in a little portrait of a woman, on ivory,
the size of a walnut, and signed and dated.
His joy was immense; but, alas! it was of short
duration. The burgomaster who owned it
would not part with it. My friend offered
sums untold for this three inches of ivory,
would have sold his estates to purchase it,
stopped at nothing in his frantic offers; but
the burgomaster was rich, too, and inflexible;
he would not sell the Karl Huth. There was
some fable in his family about it. Two obstinacies
met with a shock like the foreheads of
two elephants in combat; of course the Teuton
obstinacy beat the Gaul&rsquo;s. The Karl Huth
remained in the burgomaster&rsquo;s possession, and
my friend had such an excess of rage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
despair that it brought on gout and killed him
in an inn in that obscure Pomeranian town&mdash;all
because with three thousand five hundred
famous miniatures he failed to acquire one
obscure example. Now Madame Napraxine is
certainly not obscure, nevertheless she is the
Karl Huth of Othmar. He is one of those men
who can command and enjoy everything; therefore,
of course, he has set his heart on the only
woman, probably, in Europe who will not smile
on him. All his grand collection became worthless
to my poor friend when once he failed
to include in it that single Karl Huth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar, meanwhile, unconscious that they
talked of him, even unconscious that his passion
for his friend&rsquo;s wife had been ever suspected by
his world, found the dinner tedious, and was
not distracted by his neighbours, both of whom
were lovely women.</p>

<p>When they returned to the salons at the
further end of the great central drawing-room,
which was all white and silver, with satin
panels embroidered with silver thread, and
doors made of mirrors painted with groups of
flowers, there was seated all alone at one of
the little tables a very young girl, who wore a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
plain white gown, with a plain black sash tied
around her waist, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l&rsquo;enfant</i>, and a black ribbon
holding up the thick masses of her fair
hair.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is Cendrillon,&rsquo; thought Othmar,
moved to a vague interest as he recalled the
story which Melville had told; and he looked
on her more attentively.</p>

<p>As she rose at the entrance of the Duchess
he saw that she was very tall for her age;
the slim, straight, unornamented frock became
her: she had neither awkwardness nor self-consciousness,
neither much timidity nor any self-assertion.
There was a look about her of
spirited but restrained life which was pathetic,
the look of any high-couraged young animal
which is too early and too rudely tamed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor child!&rsquo; thought Othmar in an involuntary
pity, as he saw the Duchess go up
to her, tap her carelessly on the shoulder with
a fan, present her to another lady and with
that other lady turn away indifferently after a
few words. The girl curtsied low with perfect
grace, and resumed her seat; she appeared
used to be forgotten. She sat quite still,
neither embarrassed by neglect or solicitous of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
attention. She might have been a statue but
for her half-veiled eyes, of a luminous golden
brown shaded by long black lashes, and her
mouth like a rose, which had made him call
her a Greuze picture as she had passed him in
the boat. She had looked much happier in
the boat than she looked now in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Othmar watched her a little while. No one
approached her: the men present did not care
for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ingénues</i>; the women, it is needless to say,
cared still less. The Duchesse did not think it
necessary to trouble herself about a child who
was still in a convent and would soon be in
one for the rest of her days. She was not
averse to such an evidence of her own charity
as her young cousin presented sitting there,
carefully dressed, admirably educated, in living
testimony of the benevolence of Aurore de
Vannes; but there was no need for more than
the tap with the fan and the good-natured
indifferent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comment va-t-on ce soir, petite?</i></p>

<p>Othmar waited some ten or twelve minutes,
then approached his hostess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Duchesse, will you do me the honour to
present me to Mdlle. de Valogne?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>She stared at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Certainly&mdash;yes; why not?&mdash;But how did
you know her name? And she is only a child
at Sacré C&oelig;ur.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Melville told me her sad little story and
of all your amiability towards her. Surely she
will soon be a very beautiful woman?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle n&rsquo;est pas mal</i>,&rsquo; said the Duchess,
somewhat irritably. &lsquo;Melville is always romancing,
you know; there is nothing to be
romantic about; she is destined to the religious
life; it was her grandmother&rsquo;s wish, and
is her own. As for presenting you to her, she
is only a child; it would not be well to make
her think herself in the world. If you would
excuse me&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pray present me, Duchesse,&rsquo; he persisted.
&lsquo;I assure you I do not eat children; and if she
be doomed to take the veil so soon, the world
will lose her anyhow. But will you have the
heart to cut off all that hair?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will always have your own way,&rsquo; said
Madame de Vannes, who knew very well that
he did not have it where most he cared; then
she took him across to where her young cousin
sat, and said, &lsquo;Yseulte, Count Othmar wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to know you; he is a friend of Monsignor
Melville&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The girl made him the same grand curtsy,
which she had made before, only a little less
low than she had given to the lady. Then she
seated herself once more, and waited for him to
speak first, as we wait for a royal person to
do so.</p>

<p>He spoke to her of Melville, divining that
the way to her confidence would be through
his regard for the early period of her childhood.
She listened with pleasure to his praises
of her grandmother&rsquo;s friend, and answered him
in few syllables; but the restraint seemed to
him the result neither of timidity nor of want
of intelligence, but of the reserve which had
been imposed upon her alike at her convent
and here at Millo, where no one heeded her
unless the Duc threw her a good-natured
glance, or the Duchesse a petulant word of
censure. It was easy to see that on a nature
formed for light and laughter, the sense of
being unneeded and undesired in the home of
others had early cast shadows too deep for
childhood.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How very handsome she is!&rsquo; he thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
as he spoke of Melville and his many noble
works. Close to her he could see the exceeding
regularity of her features, the splendour of
her eyes, the purity of her complexion, which
was not the narcissus whiteness of Nadine Napraxine,
but that childlike fairness under which
the colour mantles at any passing thought, or
any effort or exercise. Her form, too, had all
the slenderness and indecision of youth, but it
had also the certainty of a magnificent womanhood.
Her low dress showed her white shoulders,
her quickly-breathing childlike breast, her
beautiful throat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All that to be wasted in a cloister!&rsquo; he
thought, with repugnance. It seemed a sin
against nature&rsquo;s finest work, youth&rsquo;s most
gracious grace. To be sixteen years old, and
to have a face as fair as a flower, and to be
the last of a great race, and yet to be doomed
to be joyless, loverless, childless, from birth
unto death, because a little gold and silver
were lacking to her! To the master of millions
it seemed the cruelest irony of fate that
he had ever encountered. Why should the
absurd codes and prejudices of the world make
him powerless to give this unhappy child out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of his abundance the little which she would
need to take her place amidst those common
human joys which the poorest can attain, but
which the selfishness of man and the customs of
society forbade to her, merely because she had
been nobly born? He was thinking of her fate
all the while that he talked to her of Melville;
he was thinking of that supple slender form
disguised under the nun&rsquo;s heavy garb, of that
abundant hair shorn and falling to the stone
floor. Could those gay, good-natured, idle,
spendthrift people who condemned her so
lightly to such a sacrifice, not surrender one of
their luxuries, one of their follies, to save her?</p>

<p>Then he pictured to himself, with a smile
at his own whimsical conceit, the tailors&rsquo; bills of
Madame de Vannes curtailed, her caprices sacrificed,
her equipages diminished, her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parties de
chasse</i> discontinued, her superfluous jewels sold,
to furnish with the result attained a dower to
her portionless cousin! These good people
called themselves Christians; nevertheless, such
generosity would have seemed to them as impossible
as to go out on to the boulevards in the
goatskin of John the Baptist. Would there
ever be a religion that should influence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
lives of its professors? Christianity had had its
own way for nigh two thousand years, and had
scarcely left a mark on the world so far as practical
renunciation went.</p>

<p>While he mused thus, he talked lightly and
kindly to the girl, but he met with little
response. The convent education had taught
her silence, and she thought that he had only
come to her side because he had pitied her
solitude; that thought made her shy and proud.
With all his good will, he failed to make
much way into her friendship, or to elicit
much more than monosyllabic replies, and he
would have felt his benevolence wearisome
had it not been that there was so much true
loveliness in her features and in her form that
he was not glad of his release when she was
called by the Duchesse to the piano.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Could you make anything of Yseulte?&rsquo;
said the Duc de Vannes to him. &lsquo;She is the true
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ingénue</i> of the novelist and dramatist; she
knows nothing beyond the four walls of the
convent. It is a type fast disappearing, even
with us, under the influence of American women
and English romances. I am not sure that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
not to be regretted; it is something, at least,
to have a girlhood like a white rose.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you are going to set the rose to wither
before the sanctuary of Marie?&rsquo; said Othmar,
still moved by his one idea.</p>

<p>The Duc shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, that is my wife&rsquo;s affair. Myself, I
think it is a pity. The child will be a magnificent
woman; but then, you see, she has no
dower. Where can she go except to the
cloisters? Listen! she sings well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She was singing then, and her voice rose
with singular richness, like the notes of a nightingale
smiting the silence of a golden southern
noon. The quality of her voice was pure and
strong, with a sound in it as of unshed tears, of
restrained, and perhaps unconscious, emotion.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And she will only sing the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laus Deo</i> and
the <i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Kyrie Eleison</i>,&rsquo; thought Othmar, &lsquo;and no
one will hear her except a few scores of sad-hearted,
stupid women, who will succeed in
making her as sad-hearted and as stupid as
themselves!&rsquo;</p>

<p>What she rendered was the sweetest of
all the simple Noëls written by Roumanille,
the song of the blind child who begs her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
mother to take her to see the Enfant Jésus in
the church, and to whom the mother long replies,
in chiding and hardness of heart: &lsquo;What
use, since thou canst not see?&rsquo; Saint-Saëns
had set the naive and pathetic words to music
which was penetrated with that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit provençal</i>
which has in it &lsquo;les pleurs du peuple et
les fleurs du printemps;&rsquo; and the voice of the
girl was pure, tender, and solemn, in unison
with what she treated.</p>

<p>Of all those who listened to her, the old
minister, who had spoken of Karl Huth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Othmar himself, were the only persons touched
by the likeness of the words of the Noël to the
destiny which awaited the singer of it.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&lsquo;Je sais qu&rsquo;au tombeau seul finit ma voie obscure,&rsquo;
</p>

<p>Othmar repeated to himself. &lsquo;Poor child!
there will be no miracle wrought for her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to him pathetic, and even cruel.</p>

<p>She had sung with science and accuracy
which were in contrast with the very youthful
cadence of her voice, and when she ceased there
was a murmur of applause. She blushed a little,
and with a composure that was almost dignity
accepted the compliments paid her, and went
back, without a word, to her seat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She would make a name for herself as an
artist if she were not the last Comtesse de
Valogne,&rsquo; thought Othmar. &lsquo;Poor child! it is
hard to bear all the harness and curb of rank
and have none of its gilded oats to eat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A pretty <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élégante</i> was now singing a song
of Judic&rsquo;s with even more suggestion by gesture
and of glance than the original version of it
gave; the air of the drawing-room rippled with
her silvery notes and their response of subdued
laughter; everyone forgot Mdlle. de Valogne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
and the Provençal Noël. When Othmar looked
again for her, she was gone: the salon saw her
no more that night.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You were soon tired, Othmar,&rsquo; said the
Duchesse. &lsquo;Naturally: what should you find
to say to a child from a convent? She has not
two ideas.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She speaks little, certainly,&rsquo; he answered;
&lsquo;but I am not sure that it is from want of
ideas; and even if she have no ideas, what
does a beautiful woman want with them?&mdash;and
she is beautiful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I thought you liked clever women.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Clever! Oh, what a comprehensive word.
It is like that balloon they advertise, which you
can either fold up in your pocket or float as
high as the moon. As for Mdlle. de Valogne,
I should think she was very intelligent, to judge
by her brow and her eyes. But convents do
not nourish their pupils on Rénan and Huxley.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Rénan?&rsquo; said the Duchess, with a charming
affectation of ignorance. &lsquo;Oh, that is the
man who writes so many volumes about himself
to explain why he cannot bring himself
to believe some story about an almond bough
that swallowed snakes! When Voltaire began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
that sort of thing, it seemed shocking, but it
was new; nowadays it is not new and nobody
is shocked; it is only tiresome.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you, Madame, who laugh, yet respect
the Church enough to sacrifice a virgin to it as
the Greek to the Minotaur?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is no other retreat possible for girls
of good family who are portionless,&rsquo; said the
Duchess very positively.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But there are many men who do not
marry for a dower.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps, but not with us; it would be
quite impossible, an unheard of thing,&rsquo; said the
Duchesse, scandalised at such a suggestive violation
of all etiquette and family dignity.</p>

<p>From time immemorial the younger sons
or the unmarriageable daughters of the Valogne,
of the Creusac, of the d&rsquo;Authemont, of all the
great races whose blood met in this child, had
hidden their narrowed fates with decorum and
stateliness in the refuge of the cloisters; why
should she, because she had been born in the
latter half of the nineteenth century, rebel
against so just a disposal? And she did not
rebel at all, would not, unless some man made
love to her and put rebellion in her head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
That man would not be Othmar; he had only
one thought&mdash;Nadine Napraxine. If she had
not been sure of that, she would not even have
presented him to her young cousin, for she was
a very proud woman despite her frivolity, and
to seek a rich alliance for a poor relative would
have seemed to her the last of degradations.
Her own people, and her husband&rsquo;s, had always
married as sovereigns do, accepting and conferring
equal advantages.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poverty has the right to be as proud as it
chooses so long as it accepts nothing; when
once it has accepted anything, it has become
mendicity,&rsquo; had said often the old Marquise de
Creusac to her granddaughter, and Yseulte
would not do dishonour to that lesson.</p>

<p>&lsquo;One can trust her implicitly,&rsquo; said Madame
de Vannes once to her husband, who had
answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, my dear; that is the result of
an old-fashioned education. When your Blanchette
and Toinon are at her age, they will
know everything objectionable under the sun,
but they will not let you know that they know
it. You are bringing them up <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">more britannico</i>!&rsquo;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p>Yseulte de Valogne, waking the next morning
and looking through the little panes of her high
window in the roof at the landscape which the
red leaves of the Canadian vine framed in
crimson, was conscious of a new interest in her
life. Some one, she did not know whom, for in
her confusion she had not heard his name, had
spoken to her with kindness, and that deference
to her incipient womanhood which is the
sweetest flattery to a very young girl. Othmar,
with the grace of his manner, the seriousness
and coldness which made him different to the
men of his time, and his handsome features, to
which an habitual reserve had given that
expression of self-control and of melancholy
which most attracts her sex, had seemed to her
imagination like some gracious knight of old
bending to pity her loneliness, and to succour
that timidity which was in so much due to
her pride and her unwillingness to be regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
with compassion and to her dread lest she
should seem to seek attention.</p>

<p>She thought of him with a vague personal
interest stronger than any she had felt in her
simple and monotonous life, since her childhood
on the Ile St. Louis had become to
her like an old book of prayer, shut up
unused, with the lavender and southern-wood
of long dead summers faded and dried inside
it. Though she was only sixteen, that childhood
seemed so far, so very far, away. It
would have appeared to Blanchette and Toinon,
with their artificial, excited, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</i> little lives, a
dull and austere childhood enough, passed
beside the infirmities and incapacities of age,
and with no other active pleasure than to
gather marguerites on the grass islands of the
Seine or to hear a Magnificat sung at Notre
Dame.</p>

<p>The rooms they lived in had been narrow
and dark, their food had been of the simplest,
their days regulated with exact and severe
precision. But she had been so happy! When
her grandmother, with the white hair like spun
silk and the thin small hands, on which one
great diamond sparkled&mdash;sole relic of a splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
past&mdash;said, with a smile, &lsquo;C&rsquo;est bien fait, mon
enfant,&rsquo; all the universe could have added nothing
to her content.</p>

<p>When the old man servant Bénoît had taken
her out to the Sainte Chapelle, or the graves
at the Abbaye, and had told her tales of how
her forefathers had died on the scaffold, in the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noyades</i>, on the battle-fields of Jemappes, or
in the slaughter of Quiberon, she had known
that purest of all pride, which rejoices in the
honour and loyalty of the dead who have
begotten us. All the air about her had been
redolent of fidelity, of courage, of dignity.
She had breathed in that fine clear atmosphere
of integrity as the transparent dianthus
drinks in the sea-water which the sunbeams
pierce with vivifying gold. When the Marquise
had sometimes taken, out of old sandal-wood
coffers, antique brocades, dusky old
jewels, faded yellow letters, perhaps a ribbon
and a star of some extinct order once worn at
Marly or at Amboise, the child had listened
with reverent ear and beating heart to the stories
which went with the relics and keepsakes, and
it had always seemed to her as if some perfume
of the past entered her very veins, as its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
fragrance is poured upwards from the root
into the flower. Nor had it been always melancholy,
that innocent, tranquil life; gentlemen
of the old courtly habits had made their bow
humbly in those narrow rooms, and the old
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gaieté gauloise</i> had laughed sometimes beneath
the sad serenity of losses nobly borne. There
had been merry days when Bénoît had taken
her in one of the boats which crossed the Seine
in summer, and had rowed to one of those
quiet nooks of which he had the secret, and
had landed with her amidst the tall hay grasses,
and had set her noonday meal there&mdash;a little
fruit and roll of bread&mdash;watching the poplars
quiver in the light, and the women work upon
the shore, and the clumsy brown brigs come
and go on the broad breast of the river; and
she had clasped a great sheaf of may and daisies
and kingcups in her arms, and had run hither
and thither in a very ecstasy of limbs set free
and eyes delighted, and had cried her delight
aloud to the old man, who had nodded and
smiled and said, &lsquo;Oui, oui, c&rsquo;est beau,&rsquo; but had
thought, with a pang at his faithful heart, &lsquo;Si
jeunesse savait&mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then, whilst she was still a young child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
there had fallen across her life the darkness of
the &lsquo;année terrible.&rsquo; The Marquise de Creusac
had been at once too brave and too poor to
quit Paris when the wall of iron and of fire
had closed in around it. Her sons had died,
one at the cavalry charge of Fræschweiler, the
other during the siege of Strasburg; she herself
never rose from her bed during that ghastly
winter, and her last breath left her lips as the
Prussians entered Paris. The horror of that
time could never wholly pass from the mind of
Yseulte. Bénoît had travelled with her to the
château of Bois les Rois, and placed her under
the roof of her only living relative, Aurore de
Vannes, who herself was momentarily saddened
and touched by the misfortunes of the country
and the loss of many of her kinsmen, and in
that chastened mood was kinder to the little
friendless fugitive than she might have been at
another and less desperate time.</p>

<p>All that time seemed very far away to
Yseulte now; to earliest youth, a few years
seems like the gap of a century.</p>

<p>Bénoît was dead now, like the mistress he
had adored and served, with that loyal service
which, in this later time, one class has lost the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
power to inspire and the other class has lost the
capacity to render; but those happy midsummer
holidays on the islets of the Seine
were always in her mind whenever she felt the
touch of the fresh air or smelt the scent of
growing leaves. They had spread a fragrance
like that of summer all over her memories of
childhood. She pitied Blanchette and Toinon,
who cared nothing for daisies and kingcups;
who tired so soon of their costly playthings;
who knew their Trouville and Biarritz by
heart, who, when they played at their games,
were either peevish or bored, and who looked
with all the scorn of fashionable eight-year-olders
on a toilette which was a season out of
date. Blanchette and Toinon would die without
ever having been young; their cousin, who
at sixteen was still entirely a child, had to die
to the world before she had begun to live.</p>

<p>She leaned out of her window in the chill
of the early morning, and she watched the
sea mists curl up and drift away before the
sun, the mountains come forth slowly from the
clouds obscuring them, the light touch and
reveal one by one the low white bastides, the
grey olive yards, the bosquets of orange and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
lemon, the fields where the young corn already
was spreading, the fantastic buildings which
diversified and vulgarised the beauty of the
scene, and the grey towers of S. Pharamond
sober and severe amidst its ilex woods by
contrast with the coquetteries and motley
phantasies of its neighbours.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; she thought for the hundredth
time, &lsquo;if it were only because he pitied me
that he talked to me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She went on wondering who he was, what
he was; she did not even know that he owned
S. Pharamond, and dared ask no one about
him; all the gay, thoughtless, inquisitive questions
which youth loves to put, whilst often too
impatient to wait for an answer to them, had
been too perpetually frozen on her lips for
silence not to have become a second nature
to her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What you can observe is well,&rsquo; her grandmother
had often said to her; &lsquo;it is the wheat
you have gleaned, and you have a right to it.
But never gain knowledge by asking questions;
it is the short cut across the fields which
only trespassers take.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At the convent any interrogations which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
she had been tempted to make had been repressed
as too apposite to be convenient, and
of the Duchesse de Vannes she would have no
more have asked a question or a favour than
she would have asked one of the lay figures
on which the Duchesse&rsquo;s marvellous costumes
were built up, bit by bit, as idea succeeded to
idea in the brains of great artists of the
toilette.</p>

<p>She had scarcely heard a dozen sentences
from Madame Aurore in the half-dozen years
through which she had spent her summer
vacations at their great castle in the Vosges,
a lonely place where she had usually only
the house-servants as companions; but in
winter at Millo she had been always happy,
for near Millo dwelt her foster-mother, a
Savoyarde, who had become well-to-do since
the time when, a poor young unwedded mother
astray on the mercy of Paris, she had been
glad to give her breast to the motherless child
of the Comtesse de Valogne. Through the
influence and aid of the Marquise de Creusac
the woman Nicole had ultimately married her
lover, a sturdy peasant of the environs of Nice,
and by thrift and hard work and good luck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and good husbandry combined, they now owned
a bastide and an orange-orchard, and could
receive &lsquo;la petite Comtesse&rsquo; with honey and
cream and conserves of their own manufactures.
They had no children, and Mlle. de
Valogne still filled in the heart of her foster-mother
the place which had been empty and
cold when a month-old baby had gasped out
its last breath of feeble life in a Paris hospital
sixteen years before.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is the good of it all, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pétiot</i> is
dead and gone?&rsquo; said Nicole Sandroz many
a time, looking over her hives and hen-houses,
her rose-beds and her green peas, all blooming
for the Paris market. But this mood was
transient; the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pétiot</i> was not to be recalled by
regret, and the solid delight of early vegetables
and their value remained to her. She was a
good woman, though hard in some ways and
greedy; but she was the only creature who
gave Yseulte de Valogne anything of the comfort
of human affection and tender, blind,
unreasoning admiration. To Nicole &lsquo;mon enfant
la Comtesse&rsquo; was an object of honest
adoration, to be waited on, worshipped, petted,
slaved for if need be; and this wholly sincere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
if clumsy, devotion had always been to the
starved heart of the girl as the one scrap of
moss on the frozen sea and shore is to the
lonely and lost voyager.</p>

<p>When the dark, hard-featured face of the
Niçoise presented itself at the convent gates
of Faïel, and with her load of oranges or
strawberries, of camellias or roses, she came
out of the hot sun into the quietness and dusk
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parloir</i> and stretched out her big sturdy
arms to her nursling, the proud eyes of
Yseulte filled with tears as no one else ever
saw them do. She was a little child once more
clinging to her nurse&rsquo;s skirts in the old panelled
rooms in the Ile St. Louis.</p>

<p>The low white walls of the bastide were
set upon a hill-side not half-an-hour&rsquo;s walk
from Millo, a fragrant, pleasant, homely place,
with violets cultured like corn, and roses grown
like currant-bushes, for the flower-shops of
Paris and the purchase of the foreigners in
Nice. The mere presence of Nicole made her
visits to the southern shore longed for and
enjoyed, and compensated to her for the fretful
teazing of her little cousins, the ill-concealed
enmity of their governesses, the perpetual sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of being undesired by any one there, and the
many slights which the indifference of her
hosts made them careless of inflicting. Aurore
de Vannes would have said, if remonstrated
with, that the girl could want for nothing. She
had two pretty rooms all to herself, and a
piano in one of them; had as many gowns as
she could wear, though, of course, at her age
they were the frocks of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pensionnaire</i>; and
could pass her time in the schoolroom or in the
gardens very much at her pleasure; she could
even drive out in the basket-carriage if Blanchette
and Toinon did not want it. The existence
must, she would have argued, at any rate
be very much livelier than the convent.</p>

<p>In the first winter she had passed at Millo
no one had come there but herself, and she
had spent her time almost wholly with her
foster-mother; later on, when the house was
full&mdash;as it was now&mdash;she obtained in her holidays
a large amount of liberty, from the fact
that it was no one&rsquo;s especial duty to look after
her. She used her freedom innocently enough,
and always took the path under the olives
which led to the flower-farm of the Sandroz.</p>

<p>Once the Duchesse had said to her irritably,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
&lsquo;What charm do you find in peasants grubbing
among peastalks and growing salad?&rsquo; But she
had not waited for an answer, which was fortunate,
as Yseulte would have been too shy to
give the true one,&mdash;that they loved her a little.</p>

<p>The Duchesse concluded that the governesses
of her children did their duty in attending
on her young cousin. The governesses, however,
were willing that one who was only an
extra charge to them should do as she chose so
long as she brought no trouble on themselves;
few mornings passed without her finding her
way to the welcome of her old nurse, to sit at
pleasure under the shadow of the orange leaves,
or drift through clear water in the big market
boat.</p>

<p>Madame de Vannes was, as the world in
general would have said, very generous to her;
her education was of the best, the clothes provided
for her were elegant and suitable, her linen
was of the finest, her boots and shoes were the
prettiest possible; the Duchesse did everything
well that she did at all; but beyond a remark
that her hair was too low or too high on her
forehead, or that she did not wear the right
gloves with the right frock, Yseulte could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
scarcely recall twenty phrases that she had
heard from her august cousin. Now and then
the heart of the girl had risen in an impulse of
ardour towards liberty, towards independence.
She was conscious of more talent than the manner
of her education had developed; in a vague
way she sometimes fancied the world might
hold some place for her, some freedom of effort
or attainment; but all the habits of obedience
made a cage for her as surely as the laws made
one. Her grandmother had written with a
hand half paralysed by death to commend her
to the care of her relative, and amongst her
dying words the command: &lsquo;Obey Aurore
as you have obeyed me,&rsquo; had been often repeated.
Any thought of rebellion was stifled
by her sense of duty as soon as it arose.</p>

<p>This morning, as she leaned out of her
window she could see the white house of the
Sandroz, half a league away, amongst the olive
foliage, and what was still more to her, the
tiny bell tower of a little whitewashed church,
the parish church of S. Pharamond, in whose
parish Millo also lay. The one cracked bell
sounding feebly for matins recalled her to the
present hour, and reminded her that the mor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>row
was the feast day of S. Cecilia to whom
the building was dedicated.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He will be so vexed if the altar be not
dressed,&rsquo; she thought. The old priest of Millo
was accustomed to look to her for that service.
The Duchesse always gave him two thousand
francs in gold for his poor at New Year, but
there her heed of her vicar ended. Yseulte,
who had no gold to give, brought him flowers
and boughs for his little, dusky, lonely place,
where only a few fishermen and peasants ever
knelt, and she sometimes sang at his Offices.</p>

<p>When she remembered the day, she wasted
no more time at the window; she drank the
cup of milk and ate the roll which the maid
appointed to her service brought, and putting
on a little hat of fur, went out through the
house where even Blanchette and Toinon were
still asleep, and only a few of the under servants
were stirring.</p>

<p>It was cold, but already grown bright, with
sunshine, and the promise of a warm noonday.</p>

<p>The gardens of Millo, with their autumn
luxuriance still prolonged, were sparkling with
sunbeams and dew-drops; their aloes and cacti
pierced with broad sword-blades the blue clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
air; the latest roses kissed the earliest camellias;
the pink, the amber, the white, the purple, of
groves of chrysanthemums, glowed in the parterres;
but she did not dare to give them even
a glance. No one ever plucked a flower there.</p>

<p>She went quickly through the alleys, and
avenues, over the lawns, and under the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">berceaux</i>,
and after walking about a mile came to where
the boundary of Millo was fixed by a high wall
of closely-clipped arbutus, and only the small
iron gate which Othmar had unlocked the previous
night gave access to the lands of S. Pharamond,
which lay beyond.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There will be sure to be something here,&rsquo;
she thought, as she turned the latch of the
gate which he had unthinkingly left open, and
passed through the aperture into the thick ilex
wood on the other side of the bearberry wall.
She was not surprised to find it open, for the
gardeners of the two houses often held communication;
and she had been constantly permitted
by those of S. Pharamond to wander
about its grounds and pluck its commoner
plants. It was a thing she had done a hundred
times in the winters she had passed at Millo.</p>

<p>There were all kinds of plants growing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
at Nicole&rsquo;s bastide; but as she had no money
to pay, the child had always felt a delicacy
in asking, for them. Her foster-mother would
indeed have refused her nothing; but to take
as a gift the late-come <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quatre-saisons</i> rose, or
the early-blooming <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clochettes</i>, which the Sandroz
could sell so highly by sending them
away in little air-tight tin boxes to Paris,
would have appeared to the generous temper
of the last of the Valognes a very ungenerous
act.</p>

<p>Othmar, who had slept ill, rose early that
day. When he had bathed and dressed, he
strolled out on to his terrace, where Nadine
Napraxine had eaten her strawberries. Though
winter, the morning was mild, the sunrise
glorious. Through the great gloom of his ilex
groves he could see the sparkle of blue waves.
It was not the scenery he cared most for;
he liked the great windy shadowy plains of
eastern Europe, the snow of mountains more
sombre and severe than these hyacinth-hued
maritime Alps, the gigantic grey walls of Atlantic
rollers breaking on rugged rocks of Spain,
or Britanny, or Scotland; but he was not insensible
to the present beauty which surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
him, if it were brighter and paler of hue, gayer
of tone, softer in character, than the scenes he
preferred.</p>

<p>He stood and looked idly, and thinking,
&lsquo;If I were wise I should go to Paris this morning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>What was the use of letting all his years
languish and drift aimlessly away for sake of a
woman who made sport of his pain? Yonder,
hidden by the curve of a distant cliff, was La
Jacquemerille, and its mistress of the moment
was, no doubt, sleeping soundly enough amongst
the lace and cambric and satin of her bed, and
would not have lain awake one moment thinking
of him, though he had thought of her all
night.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Were people ever sleepless for love?&rsquo; she
had said once, with her pretty cynical smile.
&lsquo;That must have been very long ago, before
the chemists had given us chloral!&rsquo;</p>

<p>As he stood and thus made his picture of
her in his mind sleeping, as the narcissus which
she resembled sleeps in the moonlight, he saw a
figure underneath the ilex boughs which was
not hers, but had a grace of its own, though
wholly unlike her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the figure of a girl in a grey close
dress which defined the outline of her tall
slim limbs. She wore a fur hat, and had some
fur about her shoulders; the sunbeams of the
early day touched the gold in her hair and
shone in her hazel eyes. She was gathering now
one datura, now another, of those spared by the
December mistral, and coming up to a bed of
camellias, paused doubtfully before their blossoms;
she came there like one accustomed to
the place, and who merely did what she had
often done before. Her grey gown, her sunny
hair under its crown of sable, her hands filled
with flowers, made a picture underneath the
palms, amidst the statues, against the ilex darkness.</p>

<p>He recognised the child whom he had last
seen in her white gown with the black sash
a few hours before in the Duchesse&rsquo;s drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>For the moment, he put on her appearance
there that construction which a man, subject
from his boyhood to the advances and solicitations
of the other sex, was most apt to conceive
of such an unsought visit. But as he saw how
unconcerned, natural, and childlike her move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>ments
were as she paused, now by this shrub
and now by that, or sat down on a bench
to arrange some asters in her basket, he as
rapidly discarded his suspicions and guessed
the truth, that she had been ignorant of who
he was the previous evening, and had come to
his gardens by chance or by custom.</p>

<p>As he hesitated whether to descend and
make her welcome, or to retreat unseen
into the house and tell his servants to say
nothing, she looked up and saw him. She
dropped her flowers on the grass, and turned
to run away like any startled nymph in classic
verse, but he was too quick for her; he had
descended the few steps from his terrace and
had approached her before she could fly from
him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do not be so unkind to me,&rsquo; he said, with
deference and courtesy, for he divined how
ashamed she was to have been found there.
&lsquo;There is little in these gardens after being
swept by the mistral, which is a cruel horticulturist,
but the hothouses, I hope, may give you
something worthier your acceptance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; she murmured, &lsquo;there
has been no one here so long&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>He had spoken as though her presence was
the most natural thing in the world, but neither
his composed acceptance of it or his courteous
welcome could reconcile her to the position she
occupied. She coloured painfully, and her
breath came and went in an agitation she
could not subdue.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; she stammered again;
&lsquo;I did not know&mdash;last night I did not hear your
name&mdash;there has been no one here so long.
Oh, what can you think of me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes were filled with sudden tears; her
colour faded as suddenly as it had come. She
was only a child, and had been reared by stern
formalities and by chill precepts.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Think?&rsquo; echoed Othmar; &lsquo;that you are
kind enough to treat me as a neighbour.
Neighbours are not always friends, but I hope
we shall be so. That little gate has no use in
it unless it be an open portal for friendship to
pass to and fro; I walked through it to Millo
last night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But his good nature and gentleness could
not avail to console her for what was in her
own eyes, as it would have been in that of her
relatives, an unpardonable and infamous mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>demeanour.
Now that she recognised in the
speaker the same person whom her cousin had
presented to her the previous evening, she
longed for the lawn she stood on to open and
cover her. A piteous dismay took possession
of her; would he ever believe that she had
not known him as the owner of S. Pharamond?
Would he ever believe that S. Pharamond
had been that morning, as far as her knowledge
had gone, still unoccupied as it had been for
ten mortal years?</p>

<p>All the lessons of her convent life made
her act appear in her own eyes one of inexcusable
audacity, unspeakable horror,&mdash;to
have come into the gardens of a stranger when
he was himself there to take his flowers!</p>

<p>The kindness of his gaze and the cordiality
of his welcome could do nothing to console
her; she was barely conscious of them; the
colour in her face mounted to the loose curls
escaping from her little fur cap; she laid her
basket down and joined her hands in an unconscious
supplication.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There has been no one here so long,&rsquo; she
said yet again with pathetic appeal in her
voice. &lsquo;I thought I did no harm; M. Duvel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>leroy,
the head gardener, has always let me
come when there is a feast day. Indeed, I
have never taken the rare flowers, only those
which he did not want. It is the parish church
of S. Pharamond, too; I did not know I did
wrong&mdash;pray do not blame the gardeners.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Blame them, when I am so much their
debtor! I wish you would believe that you
are the queen of all the gardens here. Why,
even still you are hesitating to pluck the
camellias!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because they told me never to touch them;
I only looked at them; I think M. Duvelleroy
sends them to Nice to sell. Indeed&mdash;indeed&mdash;I
have never taken but what he told me I might
have.&rsquo;</p>

<p>What seemed so very terrible to her was
that she must appear to the owner of S. Pharamond
as a thief of his flowers! A vague
idea flashed across her mind, that perhaps she
might pay for the value of them&mdash;but then
she had no money! The old jewels of her
mother were to be hers, indeed; but when?
She had not even seen them since her grandmother
had died; perhaps they were to be
sold to defray the cost of her entrance into con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>vent
life; she did not know. The great trouble
of her spirit was reflected in her face, which was
full of conflicting emotions; her mouth, which
had been too silent the night before, trembled
a little; the tears gleamed under her long
lashes. Othmar thought her much more interesting
with all this expression breaking up
from under the mask of white marble which
the convent had made her wear. In her
bewilderment she became altogether a child;
and the stately quiet of her manner fell away
from her like an embroidered ermine-lined
robe too heavy for her years.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do they sell my camellias&mdash;the rogues?&rsquo;
he said with a smile. &lsquo;Of course you shall go
away if you will, but not empty-handed. There
must be something better worth having than
those frost-bitten roses.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He called a man who was sweeping up
leaves on a lawn here.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go and tell your chief to cut his finest
orchids and bring them in a basket to me
himself: any other rare thing he may have in
the houses he can cut also. Mademoiselle,&rsquo;
he said, turning to the girl, &lsquo;you must not go
back to Millo with such a poor opinion of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
gardens. Is the Duchesse well? You remember
that I had the honour to be presented to
you by her last evening?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are Count Othmar?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Men call me so,&rsquo; he replied, for he never
loved that title which seemed to him so contemptible
a thing, given, as it had been, in the
beginning of the century by the first Emperor.
&lsquo;I am happy to be the owner of
S. Pharamond, since you deign to visit it.
You are at Millo every winter, I think?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am; they are not,&rsquo; she said, regaining
her composure a little. &lsquo;I did not hear your
name last night. I thought you were some
gentleman from Paris.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I live oftenest in Paris,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;but
at the present moment I come from Central
Asia. I am a friend of Monsignore Melville, as
I told you; and I hope you will believe me
when I say that, if only for his regard for you,
you would be welcome at S. Pharamond.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He spoke without compliment, seeing that
any compliment would only scare her more.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You help my parish church, did you say?&rsquo;
he continued. &lsquo;It is very disgraceful of me
never to have known it; we will get Melville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to come and preach there. Does the curé want
for anything?&mdash;is there nothing I could do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He wants a new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soutane</i> very much,&rsquo; she
said with hesitation.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then a new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soutane</i> he shall have before
the world is a week older,&rsquo; said Othmar.
&lsquo;Why will you go away? Are you too afraid
of me to venture into the house? Would you
not have some cream, some cakes, some strawberries?
What do young Graces like you live
upon? Command anything you will.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have had some bread and milk; I want
nothing; you are very kind.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you think me so, you must not treat me
so distantly. You must make me a friend of
yours. The Duchesse herself presented me
last night. You seem determined to forget
that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She stood inclined to go away, unwilling
to seem ungrateful, yet afraid to remain; a
charming picture of confusion and indecision,
mingled with a gravity and a grace beyond her
years. The Greuze face which he had seen in
the boat bore the full force of the morning
light as a rose bears it, the pure tints only
deepened and illumined by it. Under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
straight simple lines of the grey stuff gown the
budding beauties of a still childish form could
be divined; in her embarrassment her colour
still came and went; her large eyes, of a golden
hazel, were almost black from the shadow of
their lashes. So far as a man whose heart and
senses are engrossed by one woman can be
alive to the loveliness of another, Othmar was
sensible of this youthful and poetic beauty,
which seemed to belong to the first fresh hours
of the morning, and to be born of it as the
rosebuds were.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hope you will not be angry,&rsquo; she said
anxiously. &lsquo;It was my fault. At Millo no
one must touch a single flower, and the curé
likes to see the altar pretty, and so one day&mdash;oh,
that is quite a long time ago, three winters
ago&mdash;I happened to see the gate open into
these grounds, and I asked M. Henri if I might
gather what he did not care to sell, and he said
that I was welcome always to the common
flowers. You will not blame him, if you please,
for it was altogether my fault.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She had seldom made a speech so long in
her life, and she paused, ashamed of the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of her voice in the quiet of the morning air.
She feared also that she was doing wrong to
speak at all to this stranger, all owner of S.
Pharamond though he might be.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All that I am inclined to blame him for,&rsquo;
answered Othmar, &lsquo;is for having laid any restrictions
upon you; he has no right to sell
even a sprig of mignonette. These gardens
are not kept for profit; they can have no happier
use than to contribute to your pleasure
and to the altars of the church. Pray, do not
go; wait a moment for this criminal to bring
us the orchids.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But she only grew more alarmed at her
own intrusion there. The easy, kindly gallantry
of his manner scarcely reassured her; she was
but a child, and a child reared in formal and
severe codes. She doubted that she was guilty
of some grave offence in standing under a palm-tree
beside a group of camellias with a person
whom she had scarcely seen before. She had
neither the habits of the world nor the conventional
badinage which could have met his
courtesy on its own ground and replied to it in
a few careless phrases. But it seemed to him
that her silence was golden, as golden as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
gleams in her changeful hazel eyes as the sun
smote on them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you would allow me to go,&rsquo; she murmured,
&lsquo;I have quite enough flowers here.
It is such a small church, and the orchids
would be much too rare&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If the orchids were made of rubies and
pearls, what happier fate could they ask than
to fall from your hands on to the altars of the
Madonna?&rsquo; said Othmar, as he broke off the
blossoms of his camellias with no sparing hand.</p>

<p>At that moment the head-gardener, alarmed
and disturbed at the message which he had
received from his master, came in sight with
a basket hurriedly filled with some of the
choicest treasures of his forcing-houses.</p>

<p>Othmar took it from him:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You did quite right,&rsquo; he said in a low
tone, &lsquo;to make my friends welcome to the
gardens in my absence, but another time, M.
Duvelleroy, make them welcome to the best;
do not reserve it for the markets and the florist
shops of Nice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The man, guilty, and taken at a disadvantage,
had no time to prepare a lie; he grew
red, and stammered, and was thankful for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
master&rsquo;s gesture of dismissal as Othmar turned
from him impatiently and offered the orchids
to the girl.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are angry with him,&rsquo; she said, anxiety
conquering her timidity.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not so; I am grateful to him,&rsquo; said Othmar.
&lsquo;But I shall, perhaps, be angry with my house-steward,
whose duty it is to keep these rogues
clean-handed. If he had given you his best
flowers I would have pensioned him for life,
but to limit you to taking what he did not
want to sell, was to disgrace S. Pharamond.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Indeed, he has been very kind all these
three winters,&rsquo; she murmured, in infinite distress
at the thought that she had inadvertently
injured the man in his master&rsquo;s opinion.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He shall wear the order of St. Fiacre if
you like, if there be such an order to reward
good gardeners,&rsquo; said Othmar gaily, seeing her
genuine anxiety on the man&rsquo;s behalf. &lsquo;I may
come and see your decorations to-morrow.
Shall I send you a load of flowers? That
would be better I think.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She looked alarmed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh no; oh pray, do not!&rsquo; she said with
earnestness. &lsquo;You are very kind to think of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Monsieur, but it would frighten the curé, and
we should not know what to do with so many,
the church is so very small&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, the colour in her
cheeks grew warm as she added:</p>

<p>&lsquo;My cousin does not know that I come
here. I do not mean that it is any secret, but
she might think it wrong, intrusive, impertinent&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She could think nothing of the sort,&rsquo; said
Othmar. &lsquo;They are three words which no one
could associate with Mdlle. de Valogne; I
am delighted my deserted house could be so
honoured. Must you go? I shall not easily
forgive myself if I frighten you away. Let me
come with you to the gate at least.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He walked beside her under the palms and
on the shaven grass down an aisle of clipped
arbutus, carrying for her the camellias, white
and rose, which he had broken off their plants
with no care for the appearance of the group
to which they belonged.</p>

<p>She was silent; she was subdued by an
unwonted sense of wrong-doing; she fancied
that she had committed some terrible indiscretion;
but how was she to have known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
that he was there, when for three winters the
camellias had blossomed unseen in those silent
evergreen ways, which no step but a gardener&rsquo;s
had ever disturbed, and where she had come
to watch the blackbirds trip over the fallen
leaves, and the fountains dance in the sunshine,
and the tea-roses shower petals of cream
and of gold on the terraces, with no more
thought or hesitation than she had gone to the
olive-yards of Nicole Sandros? Her confusion
had nothing of awkwardness. It was very
graceful, almost stately, in its silence; it was
the grave innocence, the startled hesitation, of
the young nymph surprised in the sanctuary of
the grove.</p>

<p>She accepted the orchids with a serious
gratitude, which seemed to him quite out of
proportion to the slenderness of the gift; but
when he said as much she interrupted him:</p>

<p>&lsquo;They are so beautiful,&rsquo; she said earnestly.
&lsquo;It seems cruel to have plucked them. One
fancies they will take wing like the butterflies.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are very fond of flowers?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh yes&mdash;and people waste them so. At
my cousin&rsquo;s ball last week there were five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
thousand roses. I saw them in the morning;
they were quite dead.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did you not see them at night?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;At night, no; how could I? I am not in
the world; I never shall be. Sometimes they
tell me to be an hour in the reception-rooms
after dinner; that is all; I do not care for it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But do you not wish for the time of balls
to come? Every young girl does.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I try never to think about it,&rsquo; she said
simply. &lsquo;I know it will never come for me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>There was a resignation in her words which
was more pathetic than any regrets.</p>

<p>Then with the colour hot in her cheeks
again, remembering that she was speaking too
much to a stranger, she opened the little gate
in the arbutus walk which led into the grounds
of Millo. &lsquo;I thank you very much,&rsquo; she murmured.
&lsquo;I assure you I will never come
again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And unless you come again, I assure you
that you will tell me tacitly that I have had
the misfortune to displease you,&rsquo; said Othmar,
as he held open the gate, and bowed low to
her; he saw that it would be only unkindness
to detain her or to accompany her. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
as uneasy as a bird which has flown by mistake
into a conservatory.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will come to the church to-morrow,&rsquo;
he added. &lsquo;Do you not sing there sometimes?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now and then. There is no one else to
sing. But my cousin does not approve of it.
She thinks there may be people over from
Nice; but there never are. There is no one
but the peasants.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Duchesse will not mind me,&rsquo; said
Othmar. &lsquo;Let us say <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au revoir</i>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>He kissed her hand with a careless gallantry
which made her colour over her brow and
throat, and let her leave him. She sped like a
frightened fawn over the turf and was soon
lost to sight in the bosquets of Millo.</p>

<p>Othmar strolled back to the house.</p>

<p>
&lsquo;Au tombeau seul finit ma voie obscure,&rsquo;
</p>

<p>he repeated to himself as he looked after her;
the pathos of her destiny gave her a spirituality
and a sanctity in his sight, and the song of
the blind child and its young singer for a few
moments disputed a place in his memory
with the vision of Nadine Napraxine as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
had plucked the tea-roses on his terrace to let
them fall.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That young girl would not let a rose fade,&rsquo;
he thought, &lsquo;and her own roses are to wither
between convent walls! What arbitrary caprices
has Fate! If they would only let me give her
a million&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>But they would not even have let him give
her orchids and camellias had they known it.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p>Othmar went into his house, but before taking
his coffee sent for his steward, and gave him
a brief but severe reprimand for having permitted
Duvelleroy and his underlings to use
the gardens as a nursery-ground.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The grounds may be sacked to please my
friends,&rsquo; he said, in conclusion. &lsquo;But if a
single carnation be sold for a single centime, it
is not the seller who will be dismissed, but
yourself, who are paid highly only that you
may save your subordinates from those temptations
which kill honesty and should be no more
left in the path of poor men than poisoned
mangolds in a sheep-field.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The notion that his hothouses and gardens
had furnished the flower-sellers of Nice with
materials for their myriads of bouquets, irritated
him disproportionately. He would have taken
his oath that on none of his estates did his
people steal a farthing&rsquo;s worth. They were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
highly paid, and those set in authority over
them were all men who had been chosen and
enriched by his father; he had often spoken of
their probity and affection with pride; and now
they cheated him for sake of selling a bouquet!</p>

<p>It was a mere trifle, no doubt. He would
have cleared his gardens at a stroke to please
anyone he liked; and he would have given a
poor man willingly the value of all his forcing
houses; but the knowledge that his hirelings
sold his mignonette and his heliotrope to profit
themselves irritated him, and even quite
embittered life to him for the moment. The
most generous minds feel the most acutely
betrayal in small things, and resent most
vividly the contemptible robberies which take
advantage of trust and opportunity. That the
rich man is so seldom honestly served goes
further, perhaps, to redress the balance between
him and the poor man than the latter, in his
ignorance, ever supposes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;After all,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;perhaps I only
feed rogues, like Napraxine.&rsquo; And the thought
was painful to him, for he fed them well.</p>

<p>It was primarily his own fault for so seldom
coming to the place; perhaps it was natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
that when years rolled on and they never saw
their master they should learn to consider his
possessions as almost their own. But he had
so many places that he could not live in them
all. His fathers had bought them, so, out of
respect to their memories, he could not get rid of
them. He had a great house on the Boulevard
St. Germain; another great house in Piccadilly;
another in the Teresian Platz of Vienna; he
had estates in France, England, Germany, and
Austria, a Scotch moor, a Flemish forest, a
château on the shores of the Dalmatian Adriatic,
a villa at Biarritz, a castle in dense woods on
the Moselle, and whole towns, villages, plains,
and hills in Croatia itself. How was he to live at
all these places? He lent them liberally, but he
could hardly sell them; the head of the house
of Othmar could not sell what he had inherited.
If he had sold them he would only have had
more millions with which he would not have
known what to do.</p>

<p>When he had drunk a cup of coffee and a
glass of iced water, he went for a long ride,
mounting high up into the hills until the sea lay
far below, blue as a great bed of mysotis, and
the gilded cupolas of La Jacquemerille glittered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
in his sight far beneath the darkening slopes of
pine. When he returned to his one o&rsquo;clock
breakfast, he found that his house was deserted
no more. He was told that his uncle, the Baron
Friederich, had arrived by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rapide</i> from
Paris. He was not greatly pleased, but he prepared
to do his duties as a host without betraying
his sense that the new comer was not
precisely in harmony with a romantic retreat
amidst myrtles, camellias, and bromelias.</p>

<p>But he also foresaw a tedious day and evening,
and he did not care to have the keen blue
eyes of his father&rsquo;s brother fixed on him at a
moment when he was sending telegrams in all
directions and commanding all kinds of novel
diversions to amuse and receive the Princess
Napraxine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Have your travels tended to convince you
that Europeans are wrong not to let the tails
of sheep fatten and appear at their tables?&rsquo;
said his unbidden guest, coming out of the
house as though they had parted the previous
night instead of twenty months before.</p>

<p>There was no figure better known in Paris
than that of the Baron Friederich Othmar,
familiar to society all over Europe as Baron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Fritz; a tall and portly figure carried with the
ease and vigour of manhood, though age had
whitened the hair, that was still abundant, on
the handsome head above. He never attempted
to conceal his age: he despised all <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maquillage</i>,
as all healthy and all clever men do; and if his
skin was as fair and his hands were as white and
soft as a duchess&rsquo;s, it was because nature had
made them so, and a life temperate in indulgence
though entirely unscrupulous in morals
had preserved his health and his strength unimpaired
save by occasional twinges of the
gout. With old Gaulois blood in him, Friederich
Othmar was a thorough Parisian in habit,
taste, and manner; but he was a true Slav in
suppleness, sagacity, and profound secretiveness.
Othmar thought that there was not on
the face of the earth another man with such a
hideous power of dissimulation as his uncle;
whilst the elder man, on the contrary, looked
upon such dissimulation as the mere mark
which distinguishes the civilised being from
the savage. &lsquo;Dissimulation lies at the root of
all good manners,&rsquo; he was wont to say in
moments of frankness. &lsquo;Your friend bores you
infinitely; you smile, and appear charmed!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
If you do not, you are a boor. Dissimulation
is the essence of Christianity; you are enjoined
to turn one cheek after another, and not to
show that you smart. Dissimulation is the
only thing that makes society possible; without
its amenities, the world would be a bear-garden.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On the Bourse &lsquo;Baron Fritz&rsquo; was dreaded
as the keenest-witted colossus of finance in all
Europe. His acumen was unerring; his mind
was as sensitive to the changes of the political
atmosphere as an electric wire to heat. He
perceived long before anyone else the little
cloud, not so big as a man&rsquo;s hand, which was
pregnant with storm whilst yet the sky was
clear; he heard long before anyone else the
low tremor in the bowels of the earth which
prefaced the seismic convulsion, as yet undreamed
of by a sleeping world. Therefore,
with supreme tact and matchless instinct, he
had made the House of Othmar the envy of all
its peers. &lsquo;What are statesmen without us?&rsquo;
said Friederich Othmar. &lsquo;They cannot move,
they cannot strike, unless the financiers enable
them to do so; all their combinations crumble
like a dropt bird&rsquo;s-nest unless we are willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
sustain them. If Germany had had no money,
could she have crossed the Rhine? The finest
army in the world is no more than a child&rsquo;s
set of metal soldiers if it be not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roulant sur l&rsquo;or</i>.
The statesmen are thought to be the chief
rulers and prime motors of the fate of the
world, but they can but act as we who are
behind them permit: they drag the coach; we
drive it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That I know,&rsquo; answered Othmar. &lsquo;We
have the most gigantic responsibility united
with the most utterly corrupt moral code. I
grant that we are, in a way, the Cæsars of the
modern world, but we are bestially selfish; we
are hog-like in our repletion, as all Cæsars
become. No financier ever risked ruin for a
noble impulse or for a lost cause. If he did, he
would seem mad to his guild, as Ulysses to his
companions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>All the enjoyment and sense of power
which Othmar contemptuously rejected his
uncle appreciated to the full; he was, in his
own way, a Wolsey, a Richelieu, a Bismarck.
Nothing of much importance had been done in
Europe for the last forty years without Friederich
Othmar being beneath it, in more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
degree, for weal or woe. He had those unerring
instincts which amount in their own way
to genius.</p>

<p>Endowed with one of those keen, logical,
yet imaginative brains, which are as necessary
to the great financier as to the great statesman,
he had worked unweariedly all his life long
for the sake and for the glory of the house
of Othmar; he was in no way of his nephew&rsquo;s
opinion; he considered that the world held
nothing finer than the fortunes which had
been built up out of Marc Othmar&rsquo;s kreutzers
till it was solid as so many towers of bullion;
he considered the position of the capitalist who
can refuse a king, sustain a nation, fructify
great enterprises, and constrain or restrain
great wars, was not to be exchanged with any
other power under the sun. In finance he was
inexorable, unerring; full of the finest penetration,
and the most piercing acumen; stern as
granite, piercing as steel; in private life he was
an amiable cynic, who cared for very little
except the reputation of his dinners and his
collection of water-colours. Baron Fritz was
never really content out of his little hotel,
which was as cosy as a satin-lined bag, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
where by stretching out a finger to touch an
ivory button he could put himself in communication
with all the centres of finance in
Europe. Without moving from his velvet chair
or taking his foot from its gout-stool he could
converse with his brother capitalists at all
quarters of the globe, and change the fate of
nations, and the surface of events in the course
of a winter&rsquo;s forenoon during a pause between
two cigarettes. To be able to do so seemed to
him the very flower and perfection of life. It
was to play chess with the world for your
board, and to say checkmate to living and
crowned kings.</p>

<p>Whenever he expatiated on that theme to
his nephew, Othmar only replied that he himself
did not care for any games.</p>

<p>For the rest, his one great social amusement
was whist; he could never see why men forsook
their clubs because hay was being mown and
corn reaped and grapes gathered. You bought
forage, you ate bread&mdash;very little of it&mdash;and
you drank wine, but why, because those three
things were all in their embryo state every
city in Europe should become empty he had
not patience to comprehend. No place was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
cooler, shadier, quieter, than your club. The
vast green silent country which his nephew
loved was to him an outer darkness; he detested
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le province</i> with all the maliciousness against it
of a born and bred Parisian.</p>

<p>To see a breezy common on a six-inch
square of David Cox, or a brook purling
amongst rushes by Bonnington, was to have as
much of the country as he cared to enjoy. The
stones of Vienna, the asphalte of Paris, were
the only ground he cared to tread. He had
educated his cook into perfect excellence, and
never travelled anywhere without him and his
battery of silver saucepans. &lsquo;Because you
sleep in a strange bed there is no reason why
you should let yourself be poisoned by strange
dishes,&rsquo; he invariably said.</p>

<p>On the whole he had led a happy and enviable
life; he was a perfectly selfish man, with
one great unselfish loyalty set in the midst of
his egotism, like a vein of pure marble amongst
a mass of sandstone. &lsquo;To benefit the House
Fritz would let himself be brayed in a mortar,&rsquo;
his brother had often said of him; in
private life, on the contrary, he was entirely
self-absorbed, as became a man who was one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the most notable persons in Paris; he had
never been known to lend a five-franc piece,
but he gave choice dinners three times a week,
which cost twenty napoleons for each guest.</p>

<p>Sometimes he thought with a pang of terror
of what would become of the House of Othmar
when he himself should be no more. He was
seventy years old; he would be unable to live
for ever; his arsenal of wires contained no
ivory button by which he could summon
eternal life; he had gout in his system, and he
did not disguise from himself that any day his
cook, with the silver saucepans, his pretty
aquarelles, his gigantic operations, his intense
love of life, might one and all be powerless to
keep him in his place, and then!&mdash;all the
magnitude and might of the House of Othmar
would depend solely and entirely on one
capricious and unstable young man, who only
cared for a Greek poet or a German opera!</p>

<p>On these melancholy days when he remembered
this, he voluntarily deprived himself of
his burgundy, and ate only of two dishes.</p>

<p>He was much attached to Othmar, but he
was impatient of him. He was annoyed by
what he looked upon as his crotchets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
caprices; he was irritated by the unconcealed
apathy and even scorn with which his nephew
regarded his own superb position in the world.
The dissatisfaction with which the origin of
their House filled the head of it, was to
Baron Fritz almost incomprehensible and whimsical
squeamishness. If he revered anything in
life, it was the tradition of old Marc Othmar
amassing his florins in the half-barbaric city of
Agram.</p>

<p>&lsquo;For aught we know he was a Tchigan, a
Romany,&rsquo; his nephew had said to him once;
and he had replied angrily, &lsquo;And if he were
a gipsy? Is there blood more ancient? Is
there a people freer? Is there an intelligence
more complex? What are the European races
beside the Oriental? But you know very well
that he was a pure Croat,&rsquo; he had concluded,
with intolerable impatience of such depreciation
of the founder of their greatness.</p>

<p>Although it had been the habit of his life
to follow and study the minds of men even in
their more secret thoughts, he had no patience
to attempt to understand the caprices of his
nephew&rsquo;s. It was, he thought, that kind of
ingratitude to fate which is almost an insanity;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the same sort of fractious wilfulness which made
James of Scotland love to wander disguised in
his own towns, and sent Domitian to a plot of
cabbages.</p>

<p>To Baron Fritz the power and might of the
House he belonged to had ever been in the
stead of any other religion, creed, or attachment;
he was not personally an ambitious or
an avaricious man; he had effaced himself for
his brother&rsquo;s sake, as he still slaved for his
brother&rsquo;s son; the celebrity of the House of
Othmar, their power, heavy as an elephant&rsquo;s
tread, subtle as an electric current, the magnitude
of the operations which they either
undertook or impeded, the respect with which
Europe regarded them, the weight of their own
smile or frown,&mdash;all these things were the
very breath of his life to him. He had remained,
and always willingly remained, a subordinate;
he had never resented the superiority
of his elder brother in power and position; all
he had cared to do was to give his years to the
service and aggrandisement of his race; he
would have been very astonished if he had
been told that it was in its way, after all, chiefly
a form of sentiment which actuated him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Between himself and Othmar there was
the affection of consanguinity, but no sympathy
whatever. To the elder man the
younger seemed almost blasphemously unworthy
of his heritage: the generosities and
the scruples of such a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raffiné</i> seemed to him
the perverseness of a child. Usually, Othmar
willingly abandoned to him the guidance of
their great argosy, freighted with the gold of
the world, but twice or thrice since his majority
he had interfered when he had considered a
loan immoral or an enterprise corrupt, and had
made his veto, as head of the house, obeyed
forcibly. Those few times had been unpardonable
to the Baron who had not his eccentric
and quixotic principles.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Affairs are affairs,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;If you
conduct them according to the follies and
phantasies of the Story of Arthur&mdash;adieu.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I would willingly say adieu&mdash;an eternal
adieu,&rsquo; had retorted Othmar. &lsquo;But you have
told me repeatedly that I cannot withdraw my
House from business without causing ruin on
the Bourses of Europe, and dishonouring our
name by annulling and repudiating our engagements.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course you cannot,&rsquo; had said the Baron,
to whom the mere idea seemed like a preparation
to blow up with dynamite all the mountains
of Europe and of Asia. &lsquo;Do you suppose
you can efface such an institution as our
financial existence? You might as well say
that a sovereign, by dying, could will his
country into non-existence.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then as I cannot touch the engagements
of the past, however much I condemn them, I
will at least keep pure the obligations of the
future,&rsquo; Othmar had answered; and those
transactions which his more delicate sense of
honour did not allow him to approve he refused
to permit to be undertaken.</p>

<p>Baron Fritz, who had the ordinary financier&rsquo;s
conscience, that is, who would have done
nothing commercially dishonourable, but who
cared not a straw how iniquitous might be
the results of an operation, so long as it was
legal, clever, and lucrative, was beyond measure
irritated by this occasional interference of one
who was too fine a gentleman, too indolent
a dreamer, to bear any of the frets and burden
of habitual attention to their gigantic operations.
But there was no help for it; Otho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Othmar was the head of the House, and, what
was a greater grief still to his uncle, the
only living one of the name besides himself.
They, who could have given fortunes and position
to a score of younger branches, who could
have had their sons and brothers objects of
power and worship in all the capitals of Europe,
had been so visited by death and destiny that
of them all there only remained the young
man who was Othmar to all the world, and the
old one who was Baron Fritz to his intimate
associates, and Baron Friederich to all the
Bourses.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You should marry, Otho,&rsquo; said the Baron
to him now.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have no inclination to do so,&rsquo; he answered,
and thought of Nadine Napraxine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Inclination!&rsquo; exclaimed the other irritably.
&lsquo;What has inclination to do with it? Is inclination
considered or waited for in the marriages
of princes? You are a prince in your
own way. If you died to-morrow, your race
would be extinct.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That would not much matter,&rsquo; said Othmar.
&lsquo;We have never been conspicuous for anything
except for amassing gold, as a ship&rsquo;s keel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
collects barnacles. I suppose I had better
make a will. You shall have everything for
your lifetime, and then it shall all go to the
French Republic, which is the only national
institution I know of that is capable of
muddling away two hundred milliards in a
year, with nothing whatever to show for it
afterwards.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Baron Fritz made a gesture of irritated
contempt.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You ought to have had legitimate heirs
ten years ago. You do not belong to yourself.
You have no right to live and die without
raising up posterity.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not see the obligation,&rsquo; said Othmar,
&lsquo;and I do not care enough about the name,
which you think so very fine, to greatly grieve
over its probable extinction.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Baron Fritz had heard this often, but he
never heard it freshly without an inward
shudder, such as a religious man feels before
a blasphemy. Othmar, merely as a man,
seemed to him a fanciful dreamer, an unsatisfactory
anomaly, an unphilosophic thinker,
whose theories were always playing the deuce
with his interest, and whose sympathies ran away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
with him like half-broken horses. But Othmar,
as the chief of his House, could do no wrong,
and had to be obeyed, even if he rushed on his
own destruction.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You should marry for sake of posterity,&rsquo;
he reiterated. &lsquo;You are so happily and exceptionally
situated that you can choose wherever
you please. No living woman would refuse
you. You should seek physical charms for
sake of your offspring and high lineage also;
the rest is a mere matter of taste.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The rest is only a trifle! Only character,
mind, and feeling&mdash;the three things which determine
happiness and influence life more than
anything else.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Baron Fritz made a little gesture of indifference:
&lsquo;I imagine anyone <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien élevé</i> would
not err in any of these points. Happiness one
usually finds with the wives of others. Not
that I would discourage you if you be inclined&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am not inclined,&rsquo; said Othmar, brusquely.
&lsquo;I only say that character is never considered
by men and women when they marry; yet it is
what makes or mars a life. When a marriage
is announced, what is discussed? The respec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>tive
fortunes of those concerned, then their
good looks or their lack of them; perhaps someone
adds that he is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon garçon</i>, or someone
says <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sa taille est jolie</i>, or, on the other hand,
they may say he is a fool, or she has ugly feet;
but you never hear a word as to their characters,
their sympathies, or their principles. It
is why all marriages are at best but a compromise
between two ill-assorted dispositions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Make yours well-assorted,&rsquo; said Baron
Fritz. &lsquo;If you attach so much to character,
let character be your study; myself, I have
always considered that marriage is a means of
continuing a race, so that it legally can continue
to transmit property; I have never known
why people imported fine sentiments into a
legal transaction. It is taking a false view of
a social duty to look for personal pleasure out
of it; indeed, if a man be in love with his wife
he will probably communicate his passion to
her, which is undesirable, because it awakens
her senses, and ultimately leads to her taking
a lover, or lovers, which again introduces uncertainty
into the legal enjoyment and transmission
of property.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar smiled: &lsquo;Really, Baron, you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the most profoundly immoral man I ever met.
You would always, too, subordinate humanity
to property. All human actions should, according
to you, only tend to the consolidation
and concentration of fortune; now, there is no
possible theory of human action more demoralising.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is a matter of opinion,&rsquo; said the
Baron. &lsquo;But unless your forefathers had carried
that theory into practice, you would now be
taming wild horses in Croatia, or probably you&mdash;Otho
Othmar in your entity as you are&mdash;would
not exist at all, for certainly your father
would not have wedded with an English aristocrat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is a humiliating reflection,&rsquo; said Othmar,
&lsquo;that one&rsquo;s existence depended on the accidental
union of two persons; indeed, I decline
to believe it. I am convinced that the real <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ego</i>,
the impersonal entity which has been called
the soul for want of knowing what to call it,
must have had its own independent existence;
the envelope it is slipped into is the accident;
let us think so at all events. It is more consoling
than your notion that the entire life of
A. depended on the chance of B. cohabiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
with C.; and that if B. had wedded D. instead,
A. would never have existed at all, but another
and totally different being would have done so&mdash;say
Z.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Baron shrugged his shoulders. Why,
he wondered, why on earth should a man care
about a pre-existence, or a spiritual existence, at
all, who had everything that his heart could
desire in his terrestrial life? He could imagine
that starving poets or hungry theologians
comforted themselves with those fancies, but
Othmar!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You should have been a Montalembert or
a Lamennais,&rsquo; he answered, which was a polite
way of saying that he was an imbecile.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Without being either the one or the other,
one may carry into public life the same sort
of honour which even you think incumbent on
one in public life,&rsquo; said Othmar.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said his relative. &lsquo;The code
for one has never been the code for the other.
A man in private life may not send another
man to be slain because it suits his purpose;
a man in public life, that is, as a war minister
or as an officer commanding-in-chief may send
ten thousand, fifty thousand, men to certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
slaughter. So has a diplomatist every title to
lie as much as he may need to do in the public
service, but he has no right to deceive his personal
friend in a private matter. This is not
mere casuistry; it is common-sense. Indeed,
all effective casuistry is based on common-sense.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The most dangerous casuistry is so, no
doubt,&rsquo; said Othmar. &lsquo;Because when it is so
based it is irresistible in its appeal to egotism.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not know why you use the word
dangerous,&rsquo; replied the Baron. &lsquo;Nothing is so
wholesome as to teach men to take care of
their own interests. If that lesson were universally
understood, there would be neither
paupers or criminals.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We should have a world of bankers,&rsquo; said
Othmar. &lsquo;With all deference to you, even
that would not be a Millennium.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Baron assented with good humour that
it would certainly not be one, since there
would be no investments of any kind possible.</p>

<p>The day was tedious to Othmar. He had
to examine many projects, and append his signature
to many documents. He had not dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>appeared
into Central Asia for eighteen months
without having brought upon himself the
penalty of many arrears of affairs. His assent
was merely <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pro formâ</i>, but the formula was
necessary.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He is in love still with Madame Napraxine,&rsquo;
thought his uncle, finding his attention
hard to fix. He was not sorry for that. At
Othmar&rsquo;s age he was sure to be in love with
someone, and the more he was in love the
less likely was he to meddle with the transactions
of the House.</p>

<p>The Baron could be excessively amusing,
and was so this day of his arrival at S. Pharamond;
but Othmar would gladly have been
free of his presence. He knew that the old
man would see at a glance, if he and Nadine
Napraxine met before him, that time had not
cured him of passion; and the malice and the
contempt of his uncle were both disagreeable
to him. Moreover, Othmar had been too perpetually
agreed with all his life to be pleased
by the constant enunciation of opinions and
sentiments the reverse of his own. There was
that in the tranquil cynicism of Baron Friederich
which left him with a sense of moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
nausea. Men, it is true, were not worth much;
but he could never get accustomed to the calm
manner in which his uncle was habitually ready
to sacrifice all their interests&mdash;their bodies, too,
had there been any question of them&mdash;to what
he considered advantageous to himself and to
his house in public life and finance.</p>

<p>He did not care for the new Russian loan,
for the new Turkish loan, for the great naval
dockyards to be made by Germany on the
Baltic, for the railway that was to be driven
along the ancient bed of the Oxus, nor for the
necessities of the empire of Brazil, nor for the
development of Canadian forests. It did not
interest him that such and such a sovereign
would be a cripple without his help, or such
and such a country as virtually in pawn to
him as though it had been a pledged estate;
that the assistance of his gold could enable
a Ministry to keep its tenure of office, or
the refusal of it could precipitate a State
into revolution; to Baron Fritz it was like
holding the reins of the universe, but to
Othmar himself it was excessively dull work.
The heir of four generations of money-lenders,
he was absolutely indifferent to the immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
power which lay in the stroke of his pen;
the genius of finance was inherited by him,
though dormant in him; even his uncle did
justice to the accuracy of his vision, to the certainty
of his instinct; but it was genius unused;
he had no taste to employ its capacities.
Europe was as indifferent to him as a mound
of clay.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We only do mischief, unmitigated mischief,&rsquo;
he asserted very often. &lsquo;Look at the
Canal of Suez; it has only bred wars and
pretexts for wars, and will probably embroil
England and France for the next century,&mdash;until
indeed India shall have become Russian,
or the African negro have avenged Abd-el-Kadir.
Then again take the Panama project:
it will set Great Britain and the United States
at each other&rsquo;s throats like two bull-dogs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are enough to make your father rise
from his grave,&rsquo; said Baron Fritz.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is only aristocrats who do that,&rsquo; returned
Othmar. &lsquo;The financier sleeps sound on the
remembrance of his own virtues&mdash;and loans.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The memory of his father was bitter to
him; he could not forget the injury done to
him in his earliest youth by subjecting him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to the charms and the corruptions of Sara
Vernon.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You must marry, and then you will see
things differently,&rsquo; his uncle insisted, reverting
to the simplicity of reiteration.</p>

<p>What a cruel thing was destiny! Thousands
of men who had not a crust of bread begat
legitimate offsprings in the most reckless and
profuse manner; and the one man for whom
lawful heirs were an absolute necessity and
duty obstinately neglected his obligations to
family and to the world.</p>

<p>It was possible, even probable, that the last
of the Othmars would remain the last of his
race.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Marry for me,&rsquo; said Othmar. &lsquo;I will give
all we possess to any cousins you may give
me, and keep only enough myself to live peaceably
in Arabia Felix. I have always wished
to live there; the climate is divine; and,
after all, there is nothing that is of so much
consequence as climate.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will always jest!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Most people say I am too serious. I am
not jesting at all. We have all a sort of superstition
that we must live in Europe, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
only a superstition. There is a great deal finer
weather elsewhere, and without fine weather
life is intolerable.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Have you never seen a woman you would
marry?&rsquo; asked Baron Fritz.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I have,&rsquo; said Othmar, who never
lied. &lsquo;But never one I could marry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah!&mdash;someone else&rsquo;s wife! That is just
like you. If she were not unattainable she
would have no more attraction than anyone
else. You are so whimsical.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hope not. I dislike whimsical people.
They are always asking for the windows to be
shut, or imagining that there is a drainpipe
open. Oh, some day I may marry. I do not
pledge my future. But I have no inclination
to marriage, and you will confess that you
preach what you do not practise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am seventy-one and you are thirty-two,&rsquo;
said Baron Fritz; &lsquo;I should have married fifty
years ago if I had been as you are, the head
of the House.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Curse the House!&rsquo; said Othmar, though he
was a man who never used any oaths, great or
small. But it seemed to him that the House
of Othmar was for ever on his shoulders like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Sindbad&rsquo;s burden; that he could do nothing
freely as other men did; that go where he
would he could never wholly escape from the
mephitic acid which adulation and importunity
exhale, and could never gain that simplicity of
existence which, precisely because it was denied
to him, seemed to him the chief good on earth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You speak as if the Othmars had been
Plantagenets or Comneni!&rsquo; he continued. &lsquo;It
is not quite two centuries ago that the world
did not even know that a Croat horse-dealer
bore that name! The last time I was at
Agram, I looked into the archives of the city;
nobody ever did so; they were crabbed and
hard to decipher; but I passed a day over
them when it was raining and blowing so hard
that there was not a soul abroad in the streets
except the sentries. In the municipal documents
for the year 1730 I found an account of
a famine which had been the result of floods
such as we have seen in our own day, for
science, after all, makes little way against
natural catastrophes. It was during this famine,
when every grain of wheat was worth
treble its weight in gold, that your hero Marc
Othmar made his first great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i>. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
amassed money before, but this was the grand
conception which first largely enriched him.
He had bought enormously in corn, foreseeing
a wet season and bad harvests. He had
more than he had hoped for&mdash;he had the
whole country under water. He had almost a
monopoly of grain. In those days government
aid could not come by steam, and besides,
Croatia had just then no government. In
these records it is stated that upwards of forty-five
thousand persons, chiefly women and
children, died of starvation; and all the while
they were dying Marc Othmar shut up his
grain and only sold it sack by sack, at an average
rate of a death a bushel. You find that
admirable; I do not. I confess, ever since I
put these facts together out of the fragments of
public history, it has seemed to me as if there
were an earthy smell about all our money;
you know the lungs of people who die starved
always do smell like decaying mould. It is
pure fancy&mdash;I am quite aware of that. But
even, putting fancy out of the question, I do
not see anything heroic about the figure of our
founder. He is not Hugh Lupus or Godfrey
de Bouillon.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Baron Fritz&rsquo;s patience had scarcely endured
the strain upon it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I never heard the story. I believe you
have invented it,&rsquo; he said irritably. &lsquo;If it be
true, we have no explanation, so we cannot
form a correct judgment. At the most, accepting
it as you relate it, no more was done
then by Marc Othmar than every farmer or
peasant proprietor in Europe and America
does whenever he gets a chance. Not so much
as was done by Ferdinand de Lesseps when
he sacrificed the fellahs to make his Egyptian
Canal. You cannot conduct any trade on
abstract principles or æsthetic moralities. You
must buy cheap and sell dear, or commerce
falls to the ground, and the whole superstructure
of society falls with it. As the lawyer
cannot refuse to conduct a case because he
disapproves of the morality of it, so a financier
cannot let pass a favourable operation
because he may not approve entirely of its
scope; all he has to examine are its wisdom and
utility. When once you enter the region of
motives and of principles, all is confusion. No
two men have the same views as to what is
right; you must proceed on broader lines than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
those of fanciful ethics. For instance, nothing
is more clearly immoral than the marriage of
two diseased persons, but the priest or the
mayor who should refuse to perform the
ceremonies demanded of him because he conceived
that the bodily health of the people
came before him was unsatisfactory would be
clearly overpassing the boundaries of his functions,
which are limited to the consideration of
simply legal obstacles. So, a man of business
who once concerns himself with the vague
moralities of his speculations is lost; all he has
to occupy himself with is their solvency, their
legality, and their probabilities of success or
failure. Marc Othmar, no doubt, regarded his
investments in corn in that purely practical
light.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;For a very clever man as you are,&rsquo; returned
Othmar, &lsquo;you are curiously unconscious of what
a satire your theories are on all that you most
admire. I am as entirely convinced as you
can be that Marc Othmar never gave a thought
to the twenty-five thousand people who starved
to death while his corn was shut up in granaries
and barges; all the difference between us is,
that you think this singleness of eye for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
own interest was heroic, and I think it was
not so,&mdash;that it was even as near true hellish
wickedness as humanity can go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is neither wickedness nor virtue in
questions of finance,&rsquo; said Baron Friederich,
with distress at his nephew&rsquo;s obtuseness.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is certainly no virtue,&rsquo; said Othmar.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Neither wickedness nor virtue,&rsquo; repeated
the Baron. &lsquo;They are pure abstractions, like
political economy. To talk of the immorality
of a speculation is like talking of the vices of a
rock-crystal. There is only one sin in a financial
operation; it sins if it be unsound.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Financial morality,&rsquo; then said Othmar, &lsquo;has
at least this advantage over social morality,
that it is very much simplified!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is simple as your stable&rsquo;s doctrines,&rsquo;
replied the Baron. &lsquo;If a horse be sound, he is
a good horse; if he be not sound, he is a
screw; nothing can be simpler. And the
moment that a man begins to confuse himself
with asking any more complex questions than
this one, &ldquo;Is it sound?&rdquo;&mdash;whether he engage in
a great operation of finance, or whether he be
only buying a roadster, he will be inevitably
bewildered with his own multiform require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>ments
and will fall into the hands of mere persuasive
sharpers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can buy a horse,&rsquo; said Othmar, &lsquo;but I
will leave finance to you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not always,&rsquo; said Baron Fritz, grimly,
with vivid recollections of more than one occasion
on which his nephew had interfered with
a peremptory veto to prevent some contemplated
operation of which the morality was
more doubtful than the expediency. The occasions
had been rare indeed; but they had left
an ineffaceable soreness on the mind of the
elder man; nay, he would scarcely have forgiven
them had it not been that his devotion to
Otho as to the head of the House had something
of the irrational and patient loyalty which
the Russian nation renders blindly to its
unseen Tzar.</p>

<p>As for Othmar himself, he was too impatient
of his uncle&rsquo;s laxity of principle and conscience
to do full justice to the fine qualities
which accompanied these.</p>

<p>Those huge stone palaces whose portals
bore the magic name of Othmar were sacred to
Baron Fritz as his temples to a Greek. His
nephew never passed through the great doors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
any one of them without a sense of impatience,
of distaste, without a remembrance of the twenty-five
thousand people who had died of hunger
in Croatia whilst Marc Othmar was building
up his piles of ducats and florins. The very
homage with which he was himself met within
their walls irritated him. He thought of all the
debasing worship the earth has seen the worship
of riches was the most corrupt. &lsquo;If I were a
leper they would kiss my ulcers so long as my
hand could sign a cheque,&rsquo; he thought. After
all, when Marc Othmar had used up human
lives in the furnace of his speculations he had
used up material which was but of little worth.</p>

<p>Yet despite the disdain which human nature
cannot do otherwise than awaken in those who
are the objects of its adulation if they keep
their senses clear amidst the incense fumes, his
heart was empty.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have people here to-night?&rsquo; asked
the Baron, a little later, his vigilant eyes perceiving
the preparations which were being
made in the little theatre attached to the
château.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To-morrow night,&rsquo; answered Othmar. &lsquo;A
small dinner; I hope you will remain for it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
And as Talazac, Sembrich, and other good
singers are at Nice <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">disponibles</i>, we shall have
some music afterwards and a few people; for
that you will not care.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Napraxines are here?&rsquo; enquired his
uncle, with a little smile.</p>

<p>Othmar was annoyed to feel that he changed
colour despite himself, as he answered in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Have you seen her?&rsquo; said Friederich
Othmar, carelessly. &lsquo;How do you find her?
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maladive</i> as usual?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is no woman living less <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maladive</i>,&rsquo;
said Othmar, with some irritation. &lsquo;She is glad
to make the care of her health a pretext when
she is disinclined for the world; that is all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, indeed?&rsquo; said the elder man. &lsquo;All
great rulers are allowed to be ill at their own
convenience. Will she be ill or well to-morrow
night?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Time will show,&rsquo; replied Othmar, in a tone
which closed the subject.</p>

</div>

<p>It was a tiny church which bore the name of
S. Cecilia at S. Pharamond, and was perched
on an olive-covered knoll, with the rolling
woods of the château d&rsquo;Othmar at its base
and the gardens of Millo on its right. Nicole
Sandroz and a few other families of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite
culture</i> gathered there on Sundays and holy
days; but the great people of Millo, with their
household, had their own private chapel, and
the friends to whom Othmar had lent his house
had never troubled themselves to find their
way to the little whitewashed, wind-blown sanctuary
and the lowly presbytery that leaned up
against its south wall.</p>

<p>Othmar himself, who had a score of ecclesiastics
in a score of places looking to him
for support, had hardly known that this little
church and its old purblind peasant-born curé
were upon the confines of his estate. He had
paid every year a large sum for the mainte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>nance
of S. Pharamond, as for that of each of
his houses and estates, but he had never examined
the details of the expenditure. The
advantage of an immense fortune is that you
can leave all such matters to your secretaries.
He paid them more heed than many would
have done because of the views he entertained
on the duties of saving other people from
temptation; but S. Pharamond, with all its
luxuries, elegancies, gardens, carriages, and
conservatories, was only to him as a mere
cottage, a mere toy. He had, indeed, almost
forgotten that he had owned it, until, beating
up the Bay of Genoa in a storm-tossed and
almost disabled vessel, he had suddenly remembered
that somewhere on this coast which slid
away in the dusk to the westward he had a
harbour and a quay all his own if he chose to
go thither.</p>

<p>The little church was ugly, poor, and had
been built since the Revolution; all that redeemed
it was a great climbing rose which
covered the whole of its front, and was even
flinging audacious branches upwards to the
cross upon the roof. In summer the rose
made the little plain square place a glory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
pink bloom. Inside, there were a few deal
benches, a few bad prints, a humble little altar,
and some pewter candlesticks; the presbytery
was equally as bare.</p>

<p>The old vicar lived with one servant as old
as himself; he toddled out amongst the farms,
and was scouted and scowled at by some of the
peasants, petted and welcomed by others. He
did no harm, and was quite happy if one of his
parishioners gave him a basket of figs or a dish
of seakale; he could almost have counted his
flock on his fingers. The men about there
were very radical and hard-headed; they were
all small proprietors, who cursed Millo and S.
Pharamond all the year round, though neither
the villa nor the château did them the slightest
harm. On the contrary, the stewards of both
the Duc de Vannes and Othmar had orders to
give away any rare seeds, aid in any irrigation-works,
or contribute to any need that there
might be in the neighbourhood. But the Duc
was a duke and peer of France, and Othmar
was an archimillionaire; the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite culture</i> hated
the sight of their gilded bronze gates and
their glittering high-pitched roofs.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is for you that we pay taxes!&rsquo; snarled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
one of them once to the Duc de Vannes, who
laughed and answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, my friend, if we compared notes I
think you would find that it is I who pay them
for you and yours. I have not the slightest
objection to do so, only do not let us misrepresent
matters.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But they did not want logic, and they
hated the steep shining roofs and the gates
with the gilded scroll work. What they did
not hate was Yseulte de Valogne; all countess
though she was, they pardoned her that defect
because she had always remained for them <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la
pétiote de Nicole</i>. They understood that she
was to be sacrificed to the pride of her relatives;
that because she was poor, so poor, she
was to be refused all the joys of her youth and
her sex and surrendered to the Church that
she might not offend the grandeur of her family
by making a portionless marriage. This, which
they had learned, with many exaggerations of
its enormity from Nicole and from the servants
of Millo, gave her the halo of a martyr in their
eyes; she was sacrificed to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i>, and
that fact was enough to make her sacred to
them even though she belonged to the detested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
order herself, and had not a little of its hauteur.
Besides, her tenderness to their old people, the
little gifts she made at the convent and brought
to their little ones and their women, her intrepidity
in cases of sickness in those winters
when she was alone at Millo&mdash;a mere child, but
with the courage of giants, as Nicole loved to
tell&mdash;all these, joined to her personal elegance,
which made her as unlike themselves as the
orchids in Othmar hothouses were unlike the
sweet peas and the lavender growing under
their peach trees, had combined to make of the
last Comtesse de Valogne the idol of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite
culture</i> which, with few exceptions, loathed and
execrated the brilliant idlers who rode and drove
out of the gates of Millo, and carried their
light laughter, their painted fans, their blazing
jewels, their grace and their luxuries, out on to
the illuminated terraces, under the palms and
the araucarias, amidst the lamps and the music,
regardless of the people in the distant huts and
houses on the surrounding hills who, rising to
their work, as they went to their beds, swore
savagely against them with all the unchanged
rancorous class-hatred of the Terror still alive
in them and unsatisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;But, Nicole,&rsquo; the girl said often to her
foster-mother, &lsquo;if there were no rich people, no
great people, who would buy your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">primeurs</i>,
your December peas, your January asparagus?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We should eat them ourselves,&rsquo; said Nicole,
sternly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You might do that now; but I do not think
that eating them would pay you for all they
cost you,&rsquo; said Yseulte, not very sure of her
ground, and therefore timid in treading it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We should not grow them; there would
be no need to grow them,&rsquo; said Nicole, obstinately.
&lsquo;Everybody would have his cabbage
in his pot if there were not those pestilent
aristocrats and rich folks.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you might plant cabbages now,&rsquo; insisted
her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pétiote</i>. &lsquo;Why should you not plant
cabbages everywhere now if you like? Only
you always say it is only the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">primeurs</i> that pay
well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma mie</i>, you belong to them, so you
defend them!&rsquo; grumbled her foster-mother,
finding the argument go against her. &lsquo;And
what are they going to do with you? Cut off
all your beautiful hair, and cram you between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
four stone walls all your life, because it suits
their pride to get rid of you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;One cannot live better than in God&rsquo;s
service,&rsquo; said Yseulte, with a passing blush.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, one can,&rsquo; muttered Nicole, &lsquo;when
one is sixteen years old and has a face like
yours; one could have a gallant lover, and a
loyal lord, a home of one&rsquo;s own, and children
one after another at one&rsquo;s breast.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A colour like that of the red winter roses
which she was binding up for the Nice markets
came into the girl&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am quite happy to dedicate my life to
our Mother and her poor,&rsquo; she said, in that tone
which always awed and silenced Nicole. &lsquo;All
that I fear is, not to be worthy. There have
been holy women of my race. I may never
content them as they watch me from their
places at God&rsquo;s right hand.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The coarse blunt fashion of speech of her
foster-mother, and the crude class-hatreds and
political animosities which Nicole had imbibed
from her husband often pained and offended
the delicacy and the pride of the girl; but the
rough woman loved her, was almost the only
creature that did love her, save some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
younger children in the convent; and Yseulte
bore with her faults with that indulgent affection
which is not blind, but patient and ever
forgiving.</p>

<p>She spoke in simplicity and sincerity; she
had been so drilled to behold her only future
in the religious life, that she prayed night and
day to be worthy of such election; and if a
thrill of longing for unknown freedom, for unimaginable
joys, sometimes came over her she
loyally stifled it ere it could grow to any
strength. From her babyhood she had been
taught to consider herself consecrated to the
Church, and that knowledge had always kept
her a little apart from others, made her more
serious, more sensitive, more meditative, than
her age usually is.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And, to be sure, if there be any up there
who do know, it is a crying shame that they do
not interfere,&rsquo; muttered her foster-mother, only
half abashed. But Yseulte did not hear her;
she had let the roses lie on her lap, her hands
were motionless, her eyes were looking far
away, farther than the snow which crowned the
distant mountains; she was thinking of that
saint by whom her childhood had been shel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>tered;
could it indeed be that so great a love
as her grandmother&rsquo;s had been had perished
utterly, had gone whither it knew nothing, saw
nothing, had no power to warn or save? If
it were so, she was alone indeed. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, do not think of them,&rsquo; said Nicole,
roughly; &lsquo;what is dead is dead, my sweet; be
it a pig or be it a princess, when the life is out
the sense is out with it; it rots, but it does
not wake.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said the girl, with a little frown
and a sense of pain, as if she had heard some
foul irreverence. The dead were all she had
to care for; half her young life was passed in
thinking of them, in praying for them, in
wondering if they approved that which she did.
&lsquo;Christ will give you your dower,&rsquo; her grandmother
had said often to her, a little seven-year-old
child, who had vaguely understood
that her future was pledged to heaven; and
that she must never be fractious, or noisy, or
sullen, or give way to appetite or mischief as
other children did who were less honoured. It
had made her neither affected nor hypocritical;
only pathetically doubtful of herself and capable
of repressing her naturally buoyant spirits with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
an incredible patience which was almost heroism,
but went always unrewarded.</p>

<p>Faïel was a part of the old world of Bretagne,
where the land is green and deeply wooded,
and the days are misty and soft and still; it
lies inland, and has no sight of the sea; it is
traversed by narrow roads sunk down low between
moss-grown walls of verdure; it seems all
covered up with moss and ferns and boughs;
there is always moisture in the air and there are
almost always clouds in the sky, but it is a
sweet, tender, if mournful country, and in the
late-arriving spring becomes a very bower of
flowers.</p>

<p>In the heart of this green country the
ancient village of Faïel held the equally ancient
convent of the Holy Ladies of St. Anne,
with its long grey stone walls, its steep shining
metal roofs, and its high belfry with its cross
of gilded brass towering above the low quaint
cottages which crept humbly up beneath it
many centuries ago. The foundation owed
its origin to Anne of Bretagne herself, and year
after year, century after century, undisturbed
by wars or revolutions, and unreached by any
change of thought or manners the pious ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of Faïel, in their habits of black and white,
had reared the young daughters of the Breton
nobility and gentry in the ways of God and in
such secular learning as seemed not too profane.
The community was severe in its rules
and austerely simple in all its customs; but
the children were happy if not gay; the green,
leafy, silent country was between them and the
world, the sisters were kind and gentle, the
young girls murmured together, joyously, unreproved,
like young swallows chirping under the
eaves in midsummer. This holy house in pious
Morbihan was wholly unlike those fashionable
convents of Paris, and near it, where all the
pomps and vanities of the world find their
way, and its jealousies and its rivalries fret and
fume in miniature mimicry. The Dames de Ste.
Anne had all the primitive faiths, the unblemished
loyalties, the devout beliefs in tradition
of the Middle Ages; they taught the history of
France from religious instead of secular records,
and the history of the saints from the Golden
Legend; they worked silver lilies on white
banners, and in their chapel every day a Mass
was said for Henri Cinq. Their little maidens
became under their hands simple, earnest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
grave, and most innocent and truthful creatures,
ignorant, no doubt, in many things, but possessing
a perfect courage and a beautiful candour;
such maidens as in the old days, from the
Combât des Trente to Quiberon, had become
the wives and mothers of the Breton
seigneurie, and had, if need were, defended
a castle and headed a sally of men-at-arms in
the holy cause of their duke or of their king;
women like the arum lilies that covered the
damp green earth in their native woods; women
whose eyes look at us still, serious and serene,
from the gold blazonries of illuminated missals,
where their miniatures have been painted
beneath their scutcheons and their crowns.</p>

<p>Of these children, when they had passed
from the gates of Faïel for the last time, some
went to pass all their years in the small secluded
châteaux or the dull stone-built towns
of the seashore or the interior; some, finding a
wider flight, a bolder fate, went into the life of
the world and lived that life. But wherever
they went, whatever they became, none of them
ever wholly forgot Faïel; all of them when
they bore children said, as they looked on their
little daughters, &lsquo;They shall go to the Dames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
de Ste. Anne;&rsquo; so that generation after generation
came to the great Gothic gateway, and
passed within and dwelt there for eight or ten
peaceful years; and the sisters, though death
made changes amidst them, yet seemed always
the same.</p>

<p>Yseulte, who was a fanciful child like most
of those who have a lonely childhood, used
to believe that they were like that woman of
the time of Clovis who learned the secret of
eternal life from listening to the singing of the
forest birds.</p>

<p>She used to look through the grating down
the deep green shade of the woods without,
and think, &lsquo;That is why they live so long, why
they are always content.&rsquo;</p>

<p>One day an old peasant, who was called a
witch in Faïel, saw her looking so and heard
her say something of her thoughts to her companion,
and the old crone shook her head
wisely, &lsquo;Do not wish to live long; wish to live
so that you have all heaven in one hour; it is
not the birds, nor is it the woods, nor is it the
saints, that will give you that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What does she mean?&rsquo; said Yseulte.</p>

<p>&lsquo;In the village they say she has been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
wicked woman,&lsquo; said the girl who was beside
her.</p>

<p>Yseulte pondered often on the mysterious
words, but she could never understand them.</p>

<p>At Faïel her days and years went by without
any sorrow, if without any pleasure save
such as youth and perfect health and willingness
to accomplish all allotted tasks can bring with
them. She always wore grey or black or
white; no colours were ever seen, no ornaments
were ever allowed within the sacred walls. She
was regarded as certain to enter the religious
life. &rsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tu seras des nôtres</i>,&rsquo; said the nuns so
often to her that before she was ten years old
she had grown so imbued with the idea that
she had never dreamed of resisting such a destination.
Her life was so entirely simple, in a
way so barren, that the spiritual world assumed
a proportion in it which would have been
morbid had not the high courage and bodily
healthfulness of her resisted the gloom which
those who had to do with her deemed most
fitting to the loneliness of her lot. She came of
a race of gay nobles, of reckless soldiers, of
high-handed seigneurs, and some instincts of
their courage, of their temper, of their impru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>dence,
stirred in her now and then beneath the
calm of cloistral habit and the spirituality of
her natural temperament.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you think the daughter of Gui de
Valogne will ever be a saint?&rsquo; the Duc de
Vannes often said to his wife. He thought
that blood would out even beneath the coif
of a Carmelite. His wife replied that the
Valogne had always kept their women pure,
if at the sword&rsquo;s point, and that amongst them
there had been more than one canonised;
besides, she added, Yseulte was a child both
grave and good; she would never know the
world or its temptations; she would live and
die as a lily did in a convent garden.</p>

<p>The Duc shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>&lsquo;She has her father&rsquo;s blood in her,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;and he would have suited no cloister but
Roissy or Medmenham.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He believed in very few things, but his one
belief was his conviction that the bias of a
race goes with it as do its diseases or its excellences.
Most racing men are implicit believers
in hereditary influence, and the Duc, who had
bred winners at Chantilly and at Ascot, did
not credit that the daughter of Gui de Valogne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
would contentedly become a Ste. Catherine or
a S&oelig;ur Rose.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course you may shut her perforce in
a religious house; so might you shut her in a
coffin. To be sure, the one murder is legal and
the other would not be so,&rsquo; he said, with some
ill-humour, the night after Othmar noticed his
young cousin with her long black gloves, her
stately curtsy, her sash <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l&rsquo;enfant</i>, and her
beautiful figure, which had the slimness of a
child and the promise of a goddess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I believe you are almost in love with her
yourself,&rsquo; said the Duchess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wonder no one else is wholly,&rsquo; he answered,
with petulance; and he wrote to his
jeweller in the Rue de la Paix for a locket, a
girl&rsquo;s locket; something with pearls. He thought
even a Mother Superior could hardly object to
pearls.</p>

<p>Yseulte, all unconscious of the perilous
honour projected for her by her cousin&rsquo;s lord,
passed the whole day up at the little church,
arranging the flowers which Othmar had given
her in the morning, and others which his men,
by his orders, had brought thither in the forenoon.
She was happier than she had been since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
her grandmother had died. A warm human
interest had come suddenly into the monotony
and solitude of her existence. She worked at
the decoration of the little place with ardour
and delight. She had never before possessed
such flowers as these; the woods had yielded
all those which had ever decked the altar of
the chapel at Faïel. She had only seen such
gorgeous blossoms as these in the glass-house
at Millo, where she would no more have
dreamed of gathering them than of wearing her
cousin&rsquo;s diamonds.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He shall see how beautiful it looks to-morrow,&rsquo;
she thought with each blossom that
she added, each leaf she touched. That he
would come she never doubted; a promise,
ever such a little one, was so sacred to herself
that for any pledge to be forgotten would have
seemed to her quite impossible.</p>

<p>The old vicar came and went, the sacristan
and the housekeeper stood and chattered and
told her for the hundredth time all their household
troubles; the gay sunshine streamed in
past the open door and through the dulled grey
glass of the small windows, a goat trotted up
the aisle and nibbled at the bay boughs which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
she had tied together. The morning passed like
a pleasant dream; it seemed not December to
her but May. She was but a child, and for
once the weight of her future fell off her young
shoulders. She laughed,&mdash;softly, because she
sat on the altar steps,&mdash;but she laughed. &lsquo;God
is so good,&rsquo; she thought, in the simple sincerity
of her glad gratitude.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will let me sing, my reverend, at all
the offices?&rsquo; she said to the old man when she
had finished her welcome labours and stood
with him within the stone porch whilst the sun
was setting.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Surely, my child,&rsquo; he said willingly. &lsquo;It
does me good to hear your voice, and I think
it must even be pleasant to the angels too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She went happily along the uneven little
path which led down the hill under great olive
trees and warm evening sunset skies to Millo.
Her feet went so rapidly that the maid whose
duty it was to attend her out of doors could ill
keep pace with her. Her heart was so light;
she had the vision of the beautiful flowers
always before her eyes, of the altar which she
had made like a garden. It mattered nothing
to her that when she entered the house she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
met by a reprimand, that she found her simple
supper cold, that her little cousins were
malicious, quarrelsome, unkind; all those were
trifles. She bore them with perfect patience,
and with never a word of harsh reply; and she
went to her bed and slept soundly, dreaming of
roses and lilies, and S. Cecilia, and of a world
of angels who leaned on the sunbeams as on
golden spears, and looked down on her and
smiled.</p>

<p>She was up long before the first gleam of
coming day lightened the eastward seas. No
one ever forbade her going to the church as
often as she chose; they deemed it in unison
with her future vocation. She had attached herself
to this rude, lonely, little place in the winters
which she had passed there under the charge
of Nicole Sandroz. Her cousin had said once
that it would be better if she attended instead
the offices of the house chapel, but she had
not insisted, and the child, who had a certain
obstinacy in her affections, had persevered in
her loyalty to the parish church under its
silvery mist of olives.</p>

<p>This morning her foster-mother was in
waiting to accompany her. The cold was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
keen in the greyness of the dawn; the sun,
which at noon would vivify the winter landscape
to summer-like warmth, was still hidden
in the nether world, the earth and the sea were
dark, the stars still lingered in the shadowy
skies.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What folly, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pétiote</i>!&rsquo; muttered Nicole,
who had her lanthorn, &lsquo;to get up out of your
bed to go and sing an ave! If it were to pack
a crate of oranges there would be some sense!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hush, please,&rsquo; said Yseulte gently. &lsquo;Perhaps
grandmère hears.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The memory of the old Marquise always
touched and silenced the irreligious grumbling
of Nicole. She said nothing more, but toiled
on stoutly, her lanthorn twinkling amongst the
rough grass, white with passing frost.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The child would be best in her bed,&rsquo; she
thought; &lsquo;but there is one thing,&mdash;she never
takes cold. One would like to think the saints
had a care of her, but that is all rubbish; even
our mayor says so now, and he is such a
dunderhead, what he cannot stomach nobody
can.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Still Nicole, who came to Mass for her sake,
though the good woman in her soul hated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
bigots, the black beetles, of the church, held
on her way up the hill, stumbling over the
roots of the old olives; it pleased the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pétiote</i>
that she should come, and after all it could do
no harm.</p>

<p>Eager, proud, joyous&mdash;more joyous she
feared than was meet for the sanctity of the hour
and the errand&mdash;Yseulte led her into the church
as the first pale light of daybreak spread itself
over the earth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now you will see how beautiful it is!&rsquo;
she murmured to Nicole.</p>

<p>Alas, the fair garden she had made and left
at twilight was a ruin now! Where she had
caused the metal and the wood and the stone
to bloom as with the blossoms of Paradise,
there were only poor pale yellow withered
things colourless as ashes!</p>

<p>The frost of the night had stolen the glory
from the flowers as the hand of the Church
would strike the youth from her life and leave
it hard and dumb as a stone. The blossoms
had died of cold like little children lost in the
snow, like bright butterflies beaten down and
drowned in a storm of hail.</p>

<p>A low pathetic cry of grief escaped her as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
she saw the lovely things, which she so ignorantly
and innocently had slain, hanging their
folded petals in the chill glimmer of the early
day as the limbs of infants hang in death.</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with hot quick tears that
ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, look! Oh, look!&rsquo; she cried piteously.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What could you expect, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pétiote</i>,&rsquo; said Nicole
with rough sympathy, &lsquo;if you bring hothouse
flowers from under their glass? Our
nights are cold&mdash;my man said last night it was
two below zero by the mercury tube in our
wall. Do not cry, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mignonne</i>; you could not
help it; you did not think of it; children
never do think. But bay and laurel and all
those common shrubs are best fit to stand the
cold of the church. These things are only
aristocrats.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nicole checked herself; she remembered
the Marquise de Creusac, with the frost of
poverty and cruel loss upon her, meeting misfortune
with serene courage and unchanging
dignity; her comparison, she saw, halted and
failed.</p>

<p>Yseulte did not hear; she was thinking
piteously, &lsquo;And I did so want him to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
how beautiful it all looked through his kindness!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She was quite sure that Othmar would come
to one office or another during the day. She
was ashamed to be so occupied with this one
thought when the drone of the acolyte was
chanting in monotonous sing-song the opening
words of the Mass; but it was stronger than
herself. She thought of nothing else, to her
own surprise and confusion; she was wholly
unable to keep her mind to the holy offices of
the hour; for the first time, the sonorous Latin
words failed to carry her soul with them; she
was glancing while she knelt at the closed
rickety door, she was wondering whilst she
sang the &lsquo;Agnus Dei,&rsquo; would he come? She
had taken such infinite pains with the flowers,
and now all their beauty was gone!&mdash;they
were only faded, helpless-looking melancholy
wrecks of themselves, disfiguring the altar
rather than lending it grace and glory.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pauvre pétiote!</i>&rsquo; thought Nicole, fingering
her beads, and bending her stiff knees from
habit. &lsquo;The frost will come just like that to
her, and nobody will care. Often have I a
mind to go up to Millo and tell them it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
shame, a vile shame; but they would not care,
they would have me turned out for an old mad
woman.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The church was very dark; the few lights
there were did not dissipate the shadows of the
dawn; the clear melodious voice of Yseulte rose
in the gloom as a nightingale&rsquo;s does in the
lovelier dusk of a midsummer daybreak.</p>

<p>All her heart thrilled out in it, and when
the last notes sank to silence there was a
tremor as of tears in them.</p>

<p>Nicole&rsquo;s heart swelled too as she heard, half
with pain, half with rage.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I would sooner she were singing &ldquo;do&rsquo;,
do&rsquo;, l&rsquo;enfant dor&rsquo;!&rdquo; by her baby&rsquo;s cradle,&rsquo;
thought this heathen.</p>

<p>She attended every office of the church
during the next twelve hours, but Othmar
came not to one of them. With Vespers all hope
of seeing him there&mdash;such a vague, innocent,
half-conscious hope as it was&mdash;had perished
quite, like the orchids on the altar.</p>

<p>The day was over: the church had once
more no light except that of its twinkling
candles; the peasants shuffled to their feet and
clattered out over the stones; Nicole began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
chatter to the maid; the old vicar had tottered
into the sacristy and was pulling off his vestments;
the last office was done; the butterfly
orchids were dying in the stench of the sputtering
candlewicks; the acolyte&mdash;a ploughboy
in a short linen tunic which showed his hobnailed
boots&mdash;began to put the wicks out with
a brass extinguisher fixed at the end of a long
stick; she thought she would never bring
flowers there any more&mdash;it was cruel&mdash;they
withered and faded, and who could tell what
they might suffer? She had never remembered
that before.</p>

<p>The flowers had died in the service of the
church; so would she. It had seldom seemed
hard before.</p>

<p>While the two women chattered in low
tones of the doings of Millo, she turned quickly
back to the altar-steps and knelt down there
and said one last prayer confusedly, conscious
that she had been at fault all through the Mass
in thinking of other things than the holy
services in which she had taken part.</p>

<p>She rose, with the tears in her eyes, and
went out through the little dark aisle between
the two women, leaving the poor lost flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
in a confused and shadowy mass upon the altar
until dawn, to be tossed away and thrust out
under the sacristan&rsquo;s broom to the dust-heap.
Othmar had not come.</p>

<p>He was sitting at his own table, with the
Princess Napraxine at his right hand.</p>

<p>The girl could see the lighted windows of
his château as she walked down under the
olives through the dusky furrows, already
dotted with blades of corn, the women still
chattering as they came behind her, the woods
of Millo black under the moon, the stars shining,
a distant watchdog giving tongue.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are late, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pétiote</i>,&rsquo; said her foster-mother,
kissing her hand at the door of the
house. &lsquo;But it will not matter; they are
all dining at Count Othmar&rsquo;s; if no one of
those cats of gouvernantes tell the Duchesse, she
will be none the wiser.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is nothing to conceal,&rsquo; cried Yseulte
a little coldly. &lsquo;My cousin knows that I go
out to Vespers as well as Mass. Good night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She kissed her nurse on the cheek, and
went up the staircase of Millo. Her heart
had contracted with a sort of pang as she
heard the idle words, &lsquo;They are all dining at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Count Othmar&rsquo;s.&rsquo; She did not wonder that
he had not invited her; no one invited her
anywhere; she was a schoolgirl now, and
would be a nun later on; she had nothing
to do with the world, and yet her heart ached
a little.</p>

<p>She did not touch the coffee and the cakes
that her maid brought her. She sat at the
window of her own little room, and looked
every now and then out into the chilly night
and across the moonlit landscape to the towers
of S. Pharamond. There were points of light
of all colours sparkling in the darkness round
the château. They were the lamps of his
gardens, which were illuminated down to the
very edge of the sea. She felt a great longing
to cry like a little child; but she would not
yield to it. Only two great tears rolled slowly
down her cheeks. She knew that she had
been very foolish to expect him at the church;
only he had said that he would come!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p>A few mornings later, after his noonday breakfast,
Alain de Vannes sauntered out into the
rose gardens of his wife, having seen there the
figure of his wife&rsquo;s young cousin in her demure
grey dress with the cape of sable, which he
was just then in the mood to think the prettiest
female garb in the world. He went up to
her with easy and good-humoured courtesy, as
became her kinsman and her host.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My cousin,&rsquo; he said tenderly, &lsquo;you have
no trinkets and pretty things, as a little lady of
your years should have. I believe there are
all that are left of the Valogne jewels waiting
for you in strong coffers, but meantime here
is a little bird that will whisper to you pretty
things if you will listen to him. You may
wear a dove, you know, at the convent itself.
It is the bird of the Holy Spirit.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And with that he gave her what he had
telegraphed for from Paris, a locket of blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
enamel rimmed with pearls, and a dove, made
of pearls, flying on it; it hung from a thick
gold chain.</p>

<p>She was so astonished that she could not
speak.</p>

<p>The Duc watched her with amusement.
&lsquo;Pardieu!&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;it is much more
entertaining to give to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ingénue</i> than to the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belle petite</i>. What wonder, what delight, what
innocent gratitude!&mdash;and the others only box
your ears if the diamonds be not big enough or
the emeralds do not please them. Really we
are fools.&lsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte meanwhile had not spoken yet;
what moved her so intensely was not the gift
of the medallion itself, splendid though it was,
but the idea that anyone had had so much
remembrance of her. She had scarcely had
more notice than a careless bow or a brief
&rsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon jour</i>&rsquo; from her cousin&rsquo;s husband in all her
life, and now, he brought her this magnificent
present! And yet, how much sooner she would
have had Othmar remember to go and hear
her sing!</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mignonne</i>,&rsquo; said the Duc gaily.
&lsquo;You look as if you were not sure whether you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
were in earth or in heaven. <em>We</em> are not, when
we look at you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is most good of you; it is most beautiful,&rsquo;
she said, with hesitation. &lsquo;That you should
have thought of me is so kind; but I fear
I ought not to wear it; you know in two years&rsquo;
time I am to enter the Carmelite communion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nonsense! It is the bird of the Holy
Spirit,&rsquo; said de Vannes, with an ambiguous
smile. &lsquo;I think you may wear it when you
are an abbess&mdash;if ever you be an abbess. Ah,
my child, it is a cruel thing to doom you
to the religious life; only ugly women should
go there, and you are so handsome, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fillette</i>,&mdash;you
will be so handsome!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; she said, quickly; she blushed
very much; she had been always told that
it was a sin to think of any physical charms,
and yet she had enough of the instincts of a
beautiful woman in her to take an unconscious
delight in the whiteness of her limbs, the
thickness of her hair, the smile of her own eyes
from a mirror.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes!&rsquo; said de Vannes, still with that
smile which vaguely hurt her. &lsquo;You will be
marvellously handsome, Yseulte; I think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
is the chief reason why the ladies wish you in
the cloister! It was certainly the reason why
they would not take you to Othmar&rsquo;s last night.
To be sure you are not in the world, but in the
country they might have made an exception;
you are seen in our drawing-rooms.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes with eager appeal.
&lsquo;Did he ask me? Did he think of me?&rsquo;
she said, under her breath.</p>

<p>The keen glance of the Duc flashed over
her face, and grew harsh and suspicious.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because he spoke to you once,&rsquo; he thought,
&lsquo;I suppose, though you be a young saint in
embryo, you are not proof against his millions!
You are all alike after all, you women, even in
the bud.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Aloud he said: &lsquo;Yes; I believe Othmar
bade my wife bring you. Perhaps she thought
it was too much like the great world for you;
it was a brilliant affair&mdash;all done for the Princess
Napraxine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who is the Princess Napraxine?&rsquo; she
asked, surprised at her own temerity.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She is the lady of Othmar&rsquo;s dreams,&rsquo; said
de Vannes, with an unkind satisfaction. &lsquo;You
are sure to see her here sometime. What did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
you think of him the other night? You know,
I suppose, that he could buy up all France if
he chose.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I did not know,&rsquo; she murmured. &lsquo;Nicole,
I think, said that he was rich.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Rich!&rsquo; echoed the Duc, with derision.
&lsquo;That is not a word to describe Othmar. He
has about a million millions, and he would
probably be happier if he were the blind
beggar of the Pont Neuf. His millions do not
do anything for him with Nadine Napraxine,
and it is only for Nadine Napraxine that he
exists.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he paused; the respect for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la jeune
fille</i>, by which the most dissolute of his countrymen
is restrained from long habit, making him
repress the sentence he had on his lips; that
momentary flush and light of happiness at being
remembered by Othmar which he had seen on
his young cousin&rsquo;s face had made him bitter
against his neighbour and friend, and he would
willingly have continued his sarcasms on a
man who, with all the world at his feet, cared
only for another man&rsquo;s wife, who laughed at
him.</p>

<p>Yseulte listened with serious and wistful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
eyes; she did not know enough of his meaning,
nor enough of the sympathy which had
attracted her towards Othmar, to understand
why she felt a vague pain at hearing these
things said of him mingled with a delighted
gratitude that he had remembered her. It
was not to have gone to his party that she
cared for, but to be remembered by him.</p>

<p>The children and their governesses approached
her at that moment, and the Duc
somewhat hurriedly turned away.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do not let these fools see your locket,&rsquo; he
said quickly, meaning by that epithet the wise
women who educated his daughters. &lsquo;If Cri-Cri
notice it, tell her, of course.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte, surprised at the injunction, looked
at him in wonder; but she saw so much irritation
in his expression that, being accustomed
to obey the orders of others without comment,
and to be taught that silence was one of the
first of duties, she put his gift in her pocket as
the children approached, and their father, with
a petulant word or two, turned away, lighting a
cigar.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit papa</i> saying to you?&rsquo;
cried the little sisters in a breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>They were pretty children, with clouds of
hair and saucy peevish little faces. They wore
sailor dresses, made very short at the knee
and showing legs very shapely though too
thin. Blanchette was blonde; Toinon was a
little darker and rosier. Blanchette was the
more elegant and the more witty by far; Toinon
was the sturdier and the naughtier. But
Toinon had still something of childhood left in
her; Blanchette had lost every atom of hers
years before, though she was only ten years
old now. Toinon loved horses, dogs, boats,
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le sport</i> generally; Blanchette only cared
for smart frocks, things which cost a great deal
of money, scandal which she overheard, and
which fascinated her in proportion as it was
unintelligible to her, and the sense that she
was looked at admiringly as she drove behind
the ponies in the Bois or walked, with a court
of small boys behind her, down the planks at
Trouville.</p>

<p>Between her two cousins and Yseulte de
Valogne there was a great gulf fixed, that gulf
into which there has fallen so much of the
innocence of youth, of the grace of good manners,
of the charm of girlhood, and of the obli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>gation
of nobility; that gulf over which modern
society dances so lightly, blind and indifferent
to all it has lost.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit papa</i> saying?&rsquo; cried
Blanchette and Toinon in one breath, their
eyes wide open with curiosity and sparkling
with suspicion.</p>

<p>Yseulte hesitated; she scarcely knew what
to say, and a kind of oppression came upon her
with the sense of the gift and the secret which
she had to keep and conceal.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He was telling me that I was invited&mdash;there&mdash;last
night,&rsquo; she said, as she looked
across at the trees of S. Pharamond; &lsquo;but they
thought me not old enough,&rsquo; she added, with
an unconscious sigh.</p>

<p>Blanchette turned up her little delicate nose
in the air.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande nigaude, va!</i>&rsquo; she said contemptuously.
&lsquo;You will never be anything but a
big baby, you! When I am as old as you,
I shall have been married a whole year
to a crown prince, and have gone to all the
theatres, and read all the newspapers&mdash;every
one!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But she will never see a newspaper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
never go to a theatre; never, never, never,&mdash;a
big never!&rsquo; cried Toinon, who was two years
younger than Blanchette, as she clapped her
hands and capered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She does not care, she is such a stupid,&rsquo;
said Blanchette, with all the superiority of
measureless scorn.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Papa was giving you something: what
did he give you?&rsquo; said Toinon. &lsquo;He said you
were handsome the other night to mamma, I
heard him. Mamma was angry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mamma did not care,&rsquo; said Blanchette. &lsquo;If
it had been the Marquis Raymond!&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then the little sisters laughed.</p>

<p>Yseulte with difficulty escaped from her
little tormentors, and wandered alone through
the pretty grounds; while the closed shutters
of the villa of Millo showed that her cousin
and her house-party were still sleeping after
the cotillon with which Othmar&rsquo;s party had
closed; an improvised and unexpected cotillon,
for which, nevertheless, there had been all
manner of admirable surprises, marvellous
novelties, and costly presents.</p>

<p>When she was quite alone she took out
her pearl medallion and looked at it with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
a child&rsquo;s rapture at a toy and something of a
woman&rsquo;s pleasure in a jewel. The kindness of
her cousin de Vannes overwhelmed her. She
had known him now and then, as she passed
the doors of the billiard-room, or watched
the drag roll out of the courtyard, give her a
careless, good-tempered nod and a lazy word
or two, but never any more notice than that,
which was as much as Blanchette and Toinon
ever received from him. At such times as he
had come down to Bois le Roy or Millo, when
she was there, she had heard of him as a man
only devoted to horses and dogs, to sport of
all sorts, to his stag-hounds and boar-hounds
and otter-hounds, to his coach and his stud and
his great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasses</i>; she knew that he was a very
grand gentleman in Paris, and at Bois le Roy&mdash;despite
all revolutions&mdash;was a kind of king.
And he had thought about her so much that
he had bought her a locket! She could
scarcely believe it.</p>

<p>She sat in a little nook made by magnolias
that overhung the sea, and saw the sun shine
on her dove of pearls, and wondered if she
would dare to wear it; would the Duchess
approve of it? There was only one thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
which disturbed her, it was his recommendation
to silence; there had been a look in his eyes,
too, when he had said, &lsquo;You are very handsome,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fillette</i>,&rsquo; which haunted her with a vague
uneasiness. She was too utterly innocent to
be alarmed by it, but a certain instinct in her
shrank from the remembrance of that regard.
It was the first look of sensual admiration
which had been ever given her, and though he
had added &lsquo;Of course you must tell Cri-Cri,&rsquo;
he had said it grudgingly, as though he would
willingly, if he could have ventured to do so,
have bidden her keep his gift a secret from
his wife.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you counting your jewels, Mademoiselle
de Valogne?&rsquo; said the voice of Othmar.
&lsquo;Leave that until you are thirty years older
and need their aid.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Without any thought of her he had been
strolling on the rocks above the little harbour
which belonged equally to S. Pharamond and
to Millo. He had been bathing and swimming,
and was returning to his house, when he caught
sight of her seated beneath the magnolias.</p>

<p>Yseulte coloured, and rose to her feet, dropping
the medallion in her surprise as his voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
startled her from her meditation. Othmar
picked it up and returned it to her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a happy trinket to hold your
thoughts so long,&rsquo; he said as he did so. &lsquo;I
have been watching you for a quarter of an
hour, and you have never ceased to look at
that most fortunate jewel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My cousin, the Duc de Vannes, gave it to
me a moment ago,&rsquo; she answered him, vexed
that he should suppose she could care so much
for any trifle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;De Vannes!&rsquo; echoed Othmar in some surprise;
&lsquo;I did not know he had so much good
taste in the selection either of his gifts or their
recipients. It is a very pretty medallion,&rsquo; he
added, noticing her look of distress and of
bewilderment. &lsquo;The dove is admirably done;
I hope it will be an emblem of the peace which
will always remain with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She did not speak; the quick sensitiveness
of her instincts made her feel the satire of his
felicitations, and become conscious that for
some reason or another he disapproved the
gift which she had received.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have never had any present before from
anyone,&rsquo; she said simply, &lsquo;so it is a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
pleasure to me. I do not mean only because
it is pretty&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But because of the affection it represents?
I understand,&rsquo; said Othmar, while he thought
to himself, &lsquo;That <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">goailleur</i> de Vannes!&mdash;must
he even bring his indecencies to Millo and try
and corrupt a poor helpless child? The man
would not spend twenty francs out of mere
good nature, nor look at her twice out of mere
compassion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her himself now where she
sat under the magnolia branches; and it
seemed to him as if she were the dove and
he saw the hawk descending. Alain de
Vannes could be seductive when he chose; he
was good-looking and extremely distinguished,
was accustomed to conquest, and had that
charm of manner which the habit of the world
and the society of women make second nature.
If his fancy had lighted on his wife&rsquo;s cousin he
would not be likely to pause because she was
penniless, lonely, and consecrated to a spiritual
life.</p>

<p>&lsquo;One ought to put her on her guard,
and yet, who could venture to do that,&rsquo; he
thought; he, at all events, had no title to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
so, and if he had, he could not willingly have
been the first to tell her that under the roses
there were vipers, that behind the dew and the
sunrise there were evil fires burning.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will you stay long at Millo?&rsquo; he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I came here for two months,&rsquo; she said.
&lsquo;We were all sent away,&mdash;there was fever; I
have been here often before. I am very fond
of Millo.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why would they not let you honour me
last night?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not go into the world at all. I never
shall.&rsquo; She hesitated a moment, then added
timidly, &lsquo;It was very kind to think of me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It would not be easy to forget you,&rsquo; said
Othmar with a sincerity which surprised himself.
&lsquo;I wish you had been with us; yours is
the age for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauteries</i> and enjoyment. I should
like to see you at your first ball.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall never go to a ball. It would not
be thought right.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And do you never rebel against so harsh
a destiny?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She coloured to her eyes as she answered
almost inaudibly, &lsquo;Sometimes&mdash;yes&mdash;but then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
I know that it is I who am wrong and they
who are right.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who are they?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Mother Superior; my uncle, de
Creusac, by his will; my cousin Aurore;
everyone that I belong to at all: my grandmother
especially desired it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It makes one wish all the world were
agnostic!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What did you say?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Agnostic was not a word she had been
allowed to hear.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I say that it is a cruel thing to force on
you such a choice. At least you should be
allowed to know what you do, ere you do it.
You should see what the world is like before
you renounce it. I can fancy that women
tired, sorrow-laden, unlovely, unloved, feeble of
health, may be glad of the refuge of religious
life; but you!&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you think one should only give God
what is weary and worn out?&rsquo; she said softly.
&lsquo;Surely one should give one&rsquo;s best?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar was touched by the words and the
tone. To him, whose boyhood had been filled
with spiritual faiths and hopes, and whose man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>hood
had the pain of knowledge that all these
gracious myths and wistful desires were but
mere dreams, there was the echo of remembered
adorations, of exquisite unreasoning beliefs, in
the simple answer which bespoke that faith in
heaven which a child has in its mother, unquestioning,
undoubting, implicit in obedience and
in trust.</p>

<p>Beside the cultured mind of the woman he
loved, with its fine scepticism, its delicate
ironies, its contemptuous rejections, its intellectual
scorn, no doubt this simple, narrow, unintelligent
faith was foolish and childish, and
out of date; yet it touched him; in Yseulte
de Valogne it had an unconscious heroism, a
beautiful repose, which lifted it out of the
cramped rigidity of creeds and the apathy of
ignorance.</p>

<p>There were beneath her gravity and spirituality
a warmth, a vitality, a latent force, which
seemed to him to cry aloud for enjoyment and
expansion. Sooner or later all that teeming life
slumbering in her would awake and demand its
common rights; no creature perfectly organised
and full of health and strength can forego
the natural joys of human existence without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
suffering a thousand deaths. As yet, no doubt,
she was as innocent, as ignorant, of the tyranny
of the senses, as any shell that lay at the bottom
of the blue waters yonder. She might have
fallen from heaven that day for aught she knew
of all which, in her unconsciousness, she was
ready to renounce. But any hour that divine
innocence might be destroyed by a word,
banished at a touch. Alain de Vannes, or any
other, might choose to find sport in waking and
in slaying it; and then, how unhappy she
would be! How like a bird freshly captured,
and beating itself to death against the bars!</p>

<p>It was only in France that a high-born
and beautiful girl could be sacrificed thus because
she had no dower. Everywhere else
women without dowers were sought and taken
in marriage every day. As if a few hundred
thousand francs were needful to make youth,
and loveliness, and purity, and high lineage,
acceptable to men!</p>

<p>&lsquo;You know my cousin the Duc very well?&rsquo;
she said timidly after a long silence.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We have lived in the same world; I have
not been intimate with him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you think he would be very vexed if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
I asked Nicole&mdash;that is, my foster-mother&mdash;to
sell this locket for me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I fear he would not be best pleased. Why
should you wish to sell it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated, then answered: &lsquo;I want to
buy the vicar that new gown he wants so much.
He will never spend a centime on himself, and
his gown has been mended and mended and
mended; it is all a patchwork, and even that
is dropping to pieces, and the bishop&rsquo;s visitation
is near at hand. I thought the value of this
locket would buy a priest&rsquo;s gown, if my cousin
de Vannes would not be angry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is a pretty thought of you; it would
certainly buy many <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soutanes</i>,&rsquo; said Othmar.
&lsquo;But I think Alain would not be at all pleased
if you sold his present; and I told you the
other day that I will give the curé a new
gown myself with the very utmost pleasure.
You say that I belong to his parish.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She smiled; nevertheless, she hesitated to
accept his offer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You must have so many things to give.
Nicole says that people are always asking you
for things.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They do not always get them,&rsquo; replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Othmar, with a smile. &lsquo;If they wished only
for such useful and harmless things as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soutanes</i>,
they should always have their wish.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you so immensely rich then?&rsquo; she
asked him, opening widely her golden-brown
eyes, which looked as if the sunshine was always
shining in them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To my misfortune,&rsquo; said Othmar, annoyed.
Could not even a child of sixteen out of a
convent forget his riches? Was it possible she
too was going to ask him for something?</p>

<p>She looked at him gravely.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wonder you do not build a cathedral,&rsquo;
she said, after a pause.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A cathedral!&rsquo; he echoed, in surprise. &lsquo;I
would if I had the faith of those who used to
do so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is what I would do if I had money,&rsquo;
said she, still very gravely. &lsquo;I would build
one in the heart of a forest, with the deer and
the birds all round it; not jammed up amongst
streets and crowds like Nôtre Dame or
Chartres.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then a sudden sense came over her that
she was violating all the rules of propriety by
which her life was ordered in thus speaking out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
her thoughts to one who was almost a stranger;
in tarrying at all by the side of a man who
was of no parentage to her. She rose, a little
hurriedly, but with the stately grace which was
natural to her; the grace of old Versailles
and Marly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think I must go back to the house,&rsquo; she
said, with a little shyness. &lsquo;My cousin does
not like me to be alone, or to talk to anyone&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Duchesse will not object to me,&rsquo; said
Othmar, with the same smile as he had had
when using the same words a few days
before. &lsquo;Besides, Mademoiselle, you are in
another world than your convent. At Millo
men are not thought dragons and tigers. We
are poor creatures, indeed, but harmless; more
injured than injuring. Do not be so alarmed.
I want you to tell me a great deal more about
our vicar. Where am I to get his measure
for his gown? Will he be surprised with it?
Will you not let me send it to you that you
may take it to him? I should be ashamed to
do so. I have never been inside his church,
even to hear you sing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, you never came yesterday!&rsquo; she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
with a sigh, innocently revealing that she had
remarked his absence with regret.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To my shame and loss, I did not. I had
my uncle with me all the day, and at night a
dinner, a concert, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauterie</i>, to which I
hoped you would have been brought.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I cannot dance,&rsquo; said the child, blushing
very much as she made the humiliating
confession.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So much the better,&rsquo; said Othmar, inconsistently,
&lsquo;I am sure, however, that you would
dance with admirable grace if you danced at
all. Anyone who moves well can dance well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This time the colour in her cheeks was that
of pleasure at his praise. She was silent, looking
at him a little wistfully, recalling what De
Vannes had said of the Princess Napraxine.</p>

<p>The kindliness of his tone, its mingling of
familiarity and reverence, melted her reserve
and disarmed her shyness. There had been
that in the compliment of Alain de Vannes which
had startled and alarmed her; but in the
almost paternal gentleness and friendliness of
Othmar&rsquo;s words there was nothing to do so.
He had little to her of the chillness and
languid irony which often frightened even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
women in him, whilst he had all the graceful
courtesy of a man polished by all the habits
of the great world, and accustomed to that
pre-eminence which gives supreme ease of manner.
To her Othmar seemed a hero, a king,
an ideal among men; when her cousin had
said to her that this person, so powerful, so
great, and so rich, was also unhappy, he had
said the only thing needed to complete his
fascination for her and to make him the master
of her dreams.</p>

<p>He bowed low before her with a sense of
something holier than was often met with in
this world, and looked after her as she sped
over the lawns to the house.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A beautiful creature, with a tender heart
in her breast,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;Why could I not
meet her and find my heaven in possessing her,
instead of caring only for a woman who has
no more passion or pity than those Mexican
aloes?&rsquo;</p>

<p>As he walked home the remembrance of
Nadine Napraxine seemed like a little adder
growing in his heart, and the large eyes of
Yseulte de Valogne seemed to look into his
soul with their golden sun-rays. He was pas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>sionately
in love with the one, bitterly, angrily,
resentfully, in love; for the other he felt an
extreme pity, a sympathy, which with propitious
circumstances might become affection, an admiration
of the senses which might with time be
heightened to desire, an inclination to take her
in his arms and save her from her fate as he
might have taken up a wounded bird to save it
from the trap.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p>Yseulte the next day was sitting writing a
German theme in the children&rsquo;s room, of which
the windows opened on the gardens, when
Alain de Vannes, with a cigarette in his mouth,
pushed open the glass door and sauntered in
from the open air.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, my cousin,&rsquo; he said gaily. &lsquo;Here
you are, shut up like a little mouse. What
nonsense it is! German? What good will
that do you? When the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revanche</i> comes, we
shall speak with bullets and they will understand
as we understood. Pardieu! When
they burnt my woods in Charente!&mdash;I had a
ball in my ribs at Saarbrück; did you know
it? Where were you? In Paris?&mdash;during
the siege? A baby like you! Is it possible!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There were many other little children
there,&rsquo; said the girl with a shudder; she had
been such a little child then, that the horror of
the time had left an ineffaceable mark upon her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course, of course,&rsquo; said the Duc, seating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
himself on the edge of the table. &lsquo;But not
many of your rank. Most people got away.
Ah, to be sure, I remember your uncles de
Creusac were both shot; yes, we all lost heavily;
it is no use thinking of it; but I would give my
life to enter Berlin. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiens!</i> this is not what I
came to say, but you make one serious; why
will you not laugh? Do you know that we
have a ball next week?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I heard Blanchette saying so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, the little cat! She knows everything.
Now, this ball&mdash;would you not like to come
to it, instead of being shut up in your room
writing crabbed German characters?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is impossible.&rsquo;</p>

<p>While she said the cruel word firmly, her
heart gave a great leap of longing that was
almost hope.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not impossible; perhaps difficult,&rsquo; said
de Vannes, with a smile as he threw his cigar
out on to the grass. &lsquo;But I think I could
persuade Cri-Cri; it is a shame for you to be
shut up; you will have enough of that all your
life if you go where they say.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte was silent; her heart was still
beating tumultuously, she breathed quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;How handsome she is!&rsquo; thought the Duc.
&lsquo;She only wants that flush of life to be perfect.
Women are like alabaster lamps, unlit until
they learn envy and desire. When that flame
is lighted, then the alabaster glows.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He stooped his head and kissed her hand,
but he did it with a different touch to Othmar&rsquo;s,
and she coloured with a sense of pain and
anger.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma mie!</i>&rsquo; he murmured. &lsquo;I will undertake
to combat successfully the scruples of
your cousin; you shall see the ball next week.
Cri-Cri shall find you a frock, and jewels you
want none; you have the supreme jewel&mdash;youth;
crowns are dull without it; and, let
our dear women use what arts they may, they
cannot counterfeit it. I will be your good
genius, Yseulte, and open your prison doors.
You will not refuse me a little gratitude&mdash;a
little goodwill? Something quite simple and
commonplace will content me, you see, but you
must give it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de bon c&oelig;ur</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The words were harmless, and said little,
but his eyes as they were bent upon her said
much; much more than he knew. There was
a look in them which lighted their pale blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
with a fire from which she shrank by instinct,
as from something which scorched and hurt
her. The eyes of Alain de Vannes, like those
of most men who have lived his life and had
his experiences, were cold, jaded, passionless in
repose, but when amorous, were cruel, eager,
rapacious. Yseulte drew her hand from him;
her heart sank five fathoms deep, but she
gathered up all her courage.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are very good, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. mon cousin</i>,&rsquo; she
said with a ceremonious coldness worthy of
one twice her years. &lsquo;But do not trouble
yourself for me. That sort of pleasure would
not accord with the life that I am always to
lead. I do not know the world; I do not
wish to know it; it is never to have anything
to do with me; it is better I should not even
see it, I might only regret.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She said the little speech bravely, not
faltering once, though to make it cost her
a pang, but she crushed out all her natural
longings, all her wistful instincts, all her youthful
dreams to do so; flowers plucked up by
the roots and thrown down at the foot of the
altars of Marie. But even at this moment
the altar still seemed to her that which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
had been always told that it was, a refuge
sweet, safe, unfailing. A refuge from what?
She did not know, but a vague fear had
assailed her.</p>

<p>De Vannes looked at her with surprise and
irritation; at the bottom of his heart he was
himself ashamed of the unholy wishes which
had awakened in him, of the treacherous temptations
which he had begun to put in the path of
a girl who was his own guest, his wife&rsquo;s relative,
and whose position ought in its sheer defencelessness
to have been her best safeguard with
any man of honour. He was not without
honour, in a loose fashion, but he was very
unscrupulous when his fancy was excited. If
before her retirement to the religious life she
should have an &lsquo;affaire,&rsquo; and if that &lsquo;affaire&rsquo;
should have himself for its hero, it did not
seem to him that anything terrible would have
taken place. What was the use of occupying
a high position if one could not successfully
conduct and cover a little intrigue like that?</p>

<p>At the same time he knew that his designs
would scarcely be condoned, even by the very
light-minded set amongst which he lived, if it
were seriously known that he endeavoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
to be the first to corrupt his young cousin.
Therefore her words struck a certain nerve of
susceptibility within him; he felt a kind of
compunction before that serious and guileless
regard. Yet he was very angry. He, Alain
de Vannes, who never looked at a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fillette</i>, who
never deigned to notice any lesser thing than
some of the famous beauties of the great world,
or of the half-world, had taken the infinite
trouble to distinguish this child, to seek her
and to offer her his influence and protection,
and she had repulsed him, with her hands
lying crossed on her German books and her
rose-leaf cheeks growing neither the warmer
nor the colder for his regard.</p>

<p>He rose, and his eyebrows contracted in a
heavy frown. He was a good-humoured man
usually, but in such rare times as his will was
crossed he had the petulance and the malice
of a spoiled child.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are not wise, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fillette</i>,&rsquo; he said, with a
little laugh. &lsquo;I would be a good friend to you,
and you may want one before you are safe in
the bosom of Our Lady. I wonder the ball did
not tempt you. You would have seen your
friend Othmar&mdash;and Madame Napraxine.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he pulled the glass door open with
an impatient hand, and went out into the
grounds without, leaving behind him the
odour of his cigarette and the sting of his
last words.</p>

<p>Blanchette peeped in from behind a silk
curtain; her saucy babyish eyes were full of
curiosity and wonder.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiens</i>, Yseulte,&rsquo; she said, running up to
her cousin, &lsquo;I heard all papa said. Why should
he want you at the ball, and why should you
not go? You are a goose, such a goose!
You know papa can always make mamma do
what he chooses. He always threatens to send
away M. de Prangins.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Blanchette laughed, curling herself
up in a little ball at her cousin&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You should not say such wicked things,
Blanchette,&rsquo; said Yseulte; &lsquo;and it is very
shameful and dishonourable to listen anywhere
unseen&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Blanchette made a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pied de nez</i> with her little
rosy fingers, with all the mockery and insolence
of Gavrôche himself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are vulgar as well as wicked,&rsquo; said her
cousin sadly, as she looked away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;It is distinguished to be vulgar, now,&rsquo; said
the little ten-year-old Parisienne. &lsquo;All the
great ladies are, except Madame Napraxine;
she is always wrapped up in herself. She has
no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrain</i>, she cares for nothing. She is not
at all my model. Listen! If you were not
such an idiot, you would see that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit papa</i> is
in love with you, ever so much in love! Why
don&rsquo;t you get all kinds of things out of him
while he is in the humour? He would buy
you all the Palais Royal if you knew how to
manage him, and mamma will not say anything
as long as the Marquis Raymond is here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Blanchette!&rsquo; cried the girl, indignantly.
She rose to her feet; a flood of shame seemed
to roll over her.</p>

<p>The insolent, malicious turquoise eyes of
Blanchette amused themselves with her horror
and trouble.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are such a baby!&rsquo; said the child
again, contemptuously. &lsquo;You never seem to
understand anything. Me, I understand it all.
I shall <em>do</em> it all when I am married. I shall
be just like mamma. It is the Marquis Raymond
now; it was the Prince Jacques last year.
I liked the Prince Jacques best. He gave me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
an orchestra of monkeys; you wound it up and
all the monkeys played&mdash;fife, drum, clarionet,
flute, too-too, too-too, tra-la-la-la! The marquis
has never given me anything, except a sack of
bonbons he might have bought at St. Cloud.
If he do not give me something very good at
new year, I shall say out loud in the salon,
when a lot of people are making visits: &ldquo;You
are not as nice as Prince Jacques!&rdquo; And how
he will look, because he always frets and fumes
about the prince! I think they fought about
mamma. Oh, it must be such fun to be a
woman! I wish, I wish, I wish I were fifteen.
I would be so naughty, they would have to
marry me to-morrow! If you were not a goose
you would be as naughty as ever you could
be. They would get you a husband then;
papa would see to it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Blanchette!&rsquo; cried Yseulte, again, in
desperation, not knowing how to stem the tide
of the child&rsquo;s words. She, like Blanchette herself,
was ignorant of all the horrible import of
those words which the little thing used, half in
malicious precocious knowledge, and half in
absolute childish ignorance; but they terrified
her and appalled her both in themselves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
for their speaker, and for all which, even to
her innocence, they suggested of unspeakable
inconceivable shamefulness.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Blanchette!&rsquo; echoed the child, mimicking
the horror and expostulation of her cry. &lsquo;Oh,
how glad I am I have Schemmitz and Brawn to
teach me instead of going to a convent to be
made a goose of like you. Schemmitz and Brawn
are old owls, but I keep my eyes and my ears
open at Trouville, at Biarritz, in Paris, here,
anywhere, everywhere. Now, in your nunnery
you see no more, you hear no more, than if you
were a statue in a chapel. That is why you
are so stupid. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiens!</i> Why did papa call
Count Othmar your friend? Is he your friend?
You are as still as a mouse about everything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Her quick glance saw the colour mount into
her cousin&rsquo;s face, and the cruel child laughed
triumphantly. &lsquo;Oh, how you blush, oh-oh!
Nobody blushes now-a-days. One must be old-fashioned
like you to be so silly. <em>I</em> shall never
blush. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiens</i>, Yseulte, tell me all about it and
I will not tell Toinon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is nothing to tell,&rsquo; said Yseulte,
almost losing her patience.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Papa never says anything without meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
something by it,&rsquo; said Blanchette, sagaciously.
&lsquo;And if there be nothing, why should you
blush? I know all about Count Othmar; he is
rich&mdash;oh, so rich! Nobody was ever so rich
outside the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Juiverie</i>; I heard them say so this
autumn at Aix. But all he cares about is
Princess Napraxine. Have you ever seen Princess
Napraxine? She drives in the Bois with
three horses in the Russian way; the one in
the middle is a little in front of the others, and
they have only little bits of silver for harness,
and they fly&mdash;ouf! I mean to marry a Russian.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is she so very beautiful?&rsquo; said Yseulte, in
a low tone, ashamed of questioning the child,
and yet impelled by an irresistible desire to
hear more of this wondrous sovereign.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pas tant que ça!</i>&rsquo; said Blanchette, critically.
&lsquo;But she is much more than only handsome.
She makes every one that goes near
her mad about her. She is pale, and has great
eyes; but there is no one like her, they say.
What do you think they call her? They call
her Flocon de Neige. She cares for nobody,
you know; that is what they mean. She is
not at all what I admire; what I admire is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Duchesse d&rsquo;Ambrée. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle sait se faire une
tête!</i>&rsquo;&mdash;continued Blanchette, growing breathless,
and powerless to express her immense
admiration.</p>

<p>Madame d&rsquo;Ambrée was a blonde, with a
profusion of real gold curls, cheeks admirably
tinted, and a tiny Cupid&rsquo;s bow of a mouth; a
great huntress, a great swimmer, a great
smoker; she had very extravagant toilettes,
and very loud manners, and was a really great
lady, with the language of a cantinière: she
was the object of the child&rsquo;s idolatry.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will be just like that,&rsquo; Blanchette said to
herself whenever she saw Madame d&rsquo;Ambrée
walking on the planks at Trouville, going into
the casino at Aix, or driving her piebald ponies
round the Bois. Blanchette admired her own
mother immensely, but she admired the
Duchesse d&rsquo;Ambrée still more.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maman baisse un peu</i>,&rsquo; she often said to
her sister, with a little scornful smile. She
knew that her mother was twenty-eight; to
Blanchette that age seemed to be quite hopeless
decrepitude.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yseulte,&rsquo; she said, suddenly now, &lsquo;if you
do not give me your silver prayer-book, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
shall tell mamma about you and papa. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dis
donc, sois sage.</i> Give me the silver Hours.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The silver prayer-book had belonged to a
Marquise de Creusac, in the time of Louis
Treize. It was adorned with illuminated letters,
and the coronet and initials were set in opals
on one side of the silver cover. Yseulte had
been given the book by her grandmother on
her death-bed; she used it always, and it was
the object of Blanchette&rsquo;s desires.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You know that I cannot give it you,&rsquo; said
Yseulte, gently. &lsquo;It was my grandmother&rsquo;s
last gift; it is an heirloom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Blanchette looked up from under her yellow
hair.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You had better give it me. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sois sage!</i>&rsquo;</p>

<p>She had the same expression&mdash;half menace,
half malice&mdash;that her father had had.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I cannot,&rsquo; repeated her cousin, &lsquo;I have
told you so, dear, a hundred times. I should
not have a moment&rsquo;s peace if I parted with
that book.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Blanchette said nothing more, but she made
a wheel of herself on the school-room floor, as
she had seen the boys do on the pavement in
Paris. &lsquo;Comme on est bête! Comme on est<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
bête!&rsquo; she kept thinking in her shrewd little
mind, as she stood on her wise little skull with
all the dexterity of any street-boy.</p>

<p>Blanchette at ten years old had already
resolved the problem of life with great simplicity;
its solution seemed to her to consist in
getting whatever you wanted by being detestable
whenever you did not get it.</p>

<p>On the night of the ball, when the first
carriages rolled up to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perron</i> of Millo,
Yseulte, who had gone to bed at ten o&rsquo;clock,
but had not slept, rose and went to her
window, which looked on the front of the house.
The illuminations of the building and of the
grounds were so brilliant that the light was
almost as strong as day. The awnings hid from
her sight the steps at which the arriving guests
descended, but she could see the carriages as
they came up toward them, and she could hear
the Suisse bawl out the names of those who
arrived one after another; amongst them some
of the greatest names of Europe. At twelve
she heard the name of Othmar; but she had
not seen him, for the blinds of his brougham
were down.</p>

<p>An hour and a half later, almost the last of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the apparently endless succession of champing
horses and lamp-lit coupés, she saw one carriage
of which the window next her was
lowered as it drove up; she could see within it
a very lovely woman, with a little tiara of diamonds
on her head, and a great bouquet, made
entirely of gardenias, in her hand, and a cloak
of gold tissue, lined with ermine, drawn up as
high as her mouth. The lady&rsquo;s profile, delicate as
if it were cut in ivory, with something satirical
and mutinous in its expression, was all that
Yseulte could see of her; but she felt that in
that moment she had looked on the Princess
Napraxine. In effect, as the carriage rolled
beneath the awning, the sonorous Muscovite
name was shouted by the waiting lackeys.</p>

<p>The girl withdrew from the casement and
shut the shutters; she did not want to see any
more.</p>

<p>She lay down again, but she did not sleep.
The sound of dance music, played by the band
of the ball-room, echoed through all the villa,
which was a light modern structure, and had
little solidity in it. She did not care for the
dancing; she hardly knew what it was like;
but she thought of the lovely woman with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
pretty contemptuous profile, and the diamonds
and the gardenias in her hair. She could not
sleep for thinking of her; she was there below
in the light, amidst the music and the flowers,
and Othmar was there too. The visitants which
Alain de Vannes had wished should go to her,
envy and regret, entered her innocent soul, and
made sad ravages there, as when a rat runs
amidst a white rose and pulls its blossoms down.</p>

<p>Sleep kept aloof from her; she was ashamed
of her own thoughts, but the dawn found her
with hot wide-open eyes. The music was still
sounding, like a tireless, immortal thing that
shouted and laughed for its pleasure. It was
only the first notes of the cotillon; but to
Yseulte it sounded like the song of triumph of
the world&mdash;that world which she would never
know.</p>

<p>All her nuns and priests could not perhaps
have read her a sounder homily than the house
mutely spoke when she went timidly downstairs
and through its many rooms at sunrise.</p>

<p>The flowers covering the balustrades and
walls of the staircase were dying; the sleepy
servants were turning out the gas, putting out
the wax candles; other servants were drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
champagne and smoking cigars as they hurried
to clear away the supper tables; in the ball-room
there was a litter of dropped flowers, torn
lace, discarded cotillon toys, atoms of fringe
and of ribbon which looked scarcely better
than rags; the torches were still flaming amongst
the scorched clusters of azaleas and roses; in
the vestibule two gentlemen who had stayed to
drink some black coffee were putting on their
furs and yawning miserably; Alain de Vannes,
as he sauntered upstairs, was muttering, &lsquo;C&rsquo;est
crevant!&mdash;un bal chez soi:&mdash;on ne me reprendra
jamais!&rsquo; and a maid of his wife&rsquo;s was
recounting her griefs to a tall powdered lackey,
with sobs of rage; &lsquo;Madame m&rsquo;a donnée des
gifles, mais des gifles!&mdash;enfin&mdash;elle tomba de
sommeil et puis le petit Prangins n&rsquo;a pas été
gentil pour elle, du tout, du tout, ce soir!&rsquo;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p>Nadine Napraxine meanwhile rolled home in
the pale light of the winter morning, which
had dawned over a quiet sea and a peaceful
country. She was neither fatigued nor exhilarated
by a ball which had been one of those
long triumphs to which she was so well used.
She looked as calm, as cool, as delicate of hue,
as any Lenten lily that opens between the snow
and the moss on an April morning. She was
one of those women who can go through incredible
fatigue, whether of pleasure or of
travel, without any personal traces of it.</p>

<p>Whilst her companion, Lady Brancepeth,
nodded and slumbered, she looked out at the
landscape over which the sun was slowly dawning,
driving before its rays the white mists
which stretched over sea and mountain. There
were people moving in it: women came down
the steep stone ladders of their fields bearing
heavy loads of oranges or of vegetables; mule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
carts plodded along the cactus-lined paths;
fishermen were pushing boats into deep water;
church bells were ringing. She, with her
delicate and acute perception of what was
beautiful, found pleasure in watching the simple
hardy figures which were seen for a moment
and then disappeared beneath the mist, in
hearing the bells answer one another ringing
across the white clouds that were touching the
earth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What does it feel like,&rsquo; she wondered,
&lsquo;to sleep sound all night on a bit of sacking,
and get up in the dusk, and go into the wet
fields and labour? What do these people think
about? What do sheep think about, or oxen?
It must be much the same thing. Wilkes,
what do field-labourers think about?&mdash;you
have got ever so many at home, you ought to
know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Brancepeth felt cross at being aroused
and cross at having been asleep:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Think about?&rsquo; she murmured; &lsquo;oh, I
don&rsquo;t know; beer, I believe with us, beer and
bacon; here I should say francs, nothing but
francs, probably. What put them in your
head? And there are no labourers here in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
our sense of the word, you know; it is most of
it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la petite culture</i>, you know. I never believe
it is good for the soil, certainly not in the long
run; it can&rsquo;t be; they get everything out, they
put nothing in. Of course they think only of
the market of the day; they don&rsquo;t think of the
future, those people. That will be always the
upshot of peasant proprietors, they will always
ruin the soil.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nadine Napraxine laughed:</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a fine thing it is to be an Englishwoman;
you think of political economy and of
&lsquo;the soil&rsquo; the very moment that you wake out
of a doze! I suppose the earth will certainly
last our time; what does the rest matter?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are so&mdash;so&mdash;so egotistic and autocratic,
Nadine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Princess laughed:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; I don&rsquo;t think so. I
like a despotism, I was born under it; it saves
so much trouble, and one big despot is very
much easier to deal with than a score of little
ones, especially when you stand well at his
Court. It is always better to be judged by a
judge instead of a jury, but simpletons will not
see that.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;But how can one judge, however just,
rightfully judge a nation of millions unless he
have the eyes and ears of Vishnou? I think
you really are a despot by nature, but you are
so very disputatious that you are always ready
to repudiate your most cherished opinions for
sheer sake of argument. You should have
been a sophist.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Every question is polygonal. Look at
that gleam of light on that sail and all the rest
of the vessel lost in fog&mdash;how charming!&mdash;it is
like a picture of Aïvanoffsky&rsquo;s. That is what
I like in life; nothing said out, nothing broadly
and rudely done, everything <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à demi mot</i>, everything
suggestion, not assertion; that is the only
way to exhaust nothing, not to be wearied.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You like impressions, not pictures; that is
the new school. Everyone is not satisfied with
it. That there are people to whom these vague
wavy lines, those dim washes of colour, tell
little&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, the people to whom one must explain!
Let them all go where the sheep of Panurge
went.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish you would condescend for once to
explain something,&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
paused: Princess Nadine heard with a look of
infinite <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You mean to revenge yourself for having
been awakened out of that dose. I never explain&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfin!</i>&mdash;&mdash;tell
me what you want.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Under this slight encouragement Lady
Brancepeth gained courage to plunge straightway
into a question which she had long meditated.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will you tell me, my dear Nadine, what
you mean to do with my brother?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Madame Napraxine turned a little round
in her ermine and gold brocade, and looked
solemnly in her companion&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear Evelyn, you amaze me! Do with
him? I? With your brother?&mdash;with Lord
Geraldine? What should I do with him?
Do you want me to make a good marriage for
him? But you are there to preside over that;
and, besides, he will make one himself&mdash;some
day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Speak seriously for a moment,&rsquo; said Lady
Brancepeth with impatience. &lsquo;You are very
clever, and are fond of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-mots</i>; I am a
blunt, stupid woman, and so I like plain ones.
It is two years since Geraldine has had any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
other thought than yourself. When will you
be merciful and unmagnetise him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Does that depend on me?&rsquo; said the Princess
Nadine, with a little laugh. &lsquo;Do you want
me to make a few passes in the air with my
hand? I can do it if you wish, but I doubt
the result.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Brancepeth made an impatient movement.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor Ralph is only one amongst many,
I know, my dear; but for that very reason
surely you might spare him? You do not care
the least little atom about him&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The least little! I am a Russian, but I
do know that is not good English. I speak
better English than you do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You do everything admirably well. You
are the most intelligent as you are the most
interesting woman that I know; but you are
also the most heartless,&rsquo; answered Lady Brancepeth
with some heat. &lsquo;I am not a prude; I
can understand temptation and the weakness
that cedes to it; I can understand love and the
force that it may exercise, and I can forgive
even its follies; but your kind of coquetry I
cannot forgive. It is the exercise of a merciless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
power which is as chill as a vivisector&rsquo;s attitude
before his victim. You have no sympathy or
compassion; you have only a sort of cynical
amusement in what you do; you make yourself
the centre of a man&rsquo;s life with no more
effort than you use that fan; the man is
nothing to you, nothing on earth; but you
destroy all his peace, all his future&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear Wilkes, do not be so tragic!&rsquo; murmured
Princess Napraxine, with a little yawn.
&lsquo;I dislike tragedy; I never by any chance go
to Perrin&rsquo;s when they play one. If men are
fond of me&mdash;as you say&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;As I say!&rsquo; ejaculated Lady Brancepeth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;As you say; it is merely because&mdash;as you
wisely if ungrammatically observed&mdash;it is because
I do not care the &ldquo;least little atom&rdquo;
about any one of them. I should have exceedingly
liked to care for Platon; it would
have been something new; it would have
agreed with my programme of life; it would
have suited me in every way; but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n&rsquo;aime pas
qui veut</i>; who <em>could</em> care for Platon? Does
anybody ever care for a good-natured, very
big, and entirely uninteresting person who
drinks brandy and grows bald?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;You beg my question,&rsquo; retorted Lady
Brancepeth; &lsquo;you know very well that I am
not talking of your husband.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then you ought to be if you be not!
You are a very immoral woman to recommend
me to care for anybody else,&rsquo; said the Princess
with her soft, quiet little laugh, that was as
pretty as the coo of a wood dove but by no
means so harmless.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You would exasperate a saint,&rsquo; cried her
companion.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I never met one,&rsquo; said Nadine. &lsquo;The
nearest approach to one that I know is Melville,
and I can put <em>him</em> out of temper.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have no doubt you can,&rsquo; said Lady
Brancepeth; &lsquo;I think you would anyone; you
do such immeasurable harm, and are all the
while as demure as a rabbit, and as innocent-looking.
My dear Princess, you are the cruellest
woman that lives! Flocon de Neige they call
you. They might much more appropriately
call you Goutte de Morphine. You enervate,
and you kill, and all the while, what do you
care? You care no more than the morphia
does.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did the ball bore you too so dreadfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
that you are so very unkind? A rabbit and
morphia! Your similes are mixed, my dear.
I am never a flirt; a flirt is a very vulgar
thing. No man lives, I can assure you, who
could say he ever had a word of encouragement
from me. That is not at all my way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth, bitterly,
&lsquo;your way is merely to look at men and destroy
them, and then laugh a little when they are
spoken of: I never reproached you with
ordinary coquetry; I reproach you with something
much more subtle, arrogant, cold, and
cruel. There is a gum of the East advertised
which does not kill flies, only attracts them, so
that they cling to it by millions, and hang there
stupidly in a throng till they die. That gum
is very like your power over your lovers; it is
just as passive, just as deadly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The gum and I were made as we are by
nature. Blame nature. The men and the flies
would do worse if they did not do that. And
pray do not talk about my lovers; I have
none.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have no serfs in Russia, but you have
moujiks; and it is still much the same thing,
as far as their submission goes.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;You are really too sarcastic, Wilkes. Was
Cri-Cri&rsquo;s champagne bad? Surely not. But
there must be something you have not digested.
Perhaps it is the caviare sandwiches. Here
we are, at home. Do go to bed and dream of
your gum, your rabbit, and your bottle of
morphine. None of these things can swim,
but I, who am a combination of them, can;
and I shall be swimming under your window
whilst you sleep.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The carriage stopped at the foot of the
terrace of La Jacquemerille, and she descended,
aided by Geraldine, who, with her husband,
had arrived a few minutes earlier.</p>

<p>Lady Brancepeth hurried indoors, conscious,
with the consciousness of thirty-five years, that
the morning light was not becoming after a
ball. Nadine Napraxine, with the equally
conscious immunity of an exquisite complexion,
and of that kind of beauty which is like a sea-shell,
unwound the lace from about her delicate
head, and paused in the doorway, looking
seaward.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall not go to bed,&rsquo; she said, as the rays
of the sunrise touched the gilded pinnacles and
vanes of La Jacquemerille. &lsquo;I shall go and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
get into a peignoir, then breakfast, and then
bathe. It is so stupid to go to bed when
the sun is up. Platon, you look like a bear
awaked before he has done hybernating. Did
you not get sleep enough in de Vannes&rsquo;
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fumoir</i>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I never get sleep enough,&rsquo; replied Napraxine,
good-humouredly but drowsily; &lsquo;and
you do a very foolish thing if you stand there,
Princess, in a frost, at seven o&rsquo;clock, after five
hours of the cotillon!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is no frost; look at the geraniums;
and I never take cold; that is not my malady
at all; I am not so silly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Napraxine opened his sleepy eyes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When you cannot live in Russia because
the tubercles on your lungs&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dr. Thiviers is responsible for the tubercles.
One is obliged to say something civil to
get away from a Court. It is always safe to
say one suffers with one&rsquo;s lungs; nobody can
ask to look at them. Pray go to bed, and
dream of Nirvana, if you know what it means.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Prince obeyed, and disappeared yawning.
Geraldine remained, gazing at this elegant
figure on the marble step, with its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sortie du bal</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
of ermine and gold silk folded about it, and
the face with its hue of a white tea-rose, which
could defy so surely the searching morning
light.</p>

<p>She glanced at him in return, and laughed.
&lsquo;How droll you look with your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">claque</i> and
your ulster; you are not harmonious with
the landscape, my friend; and you look sulky.
The ball seems to have disagreed with all of
you; yet it was a very good ball, as balls go;
it is impossible to give any variety to a ball.
Balls and funerals, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ça se ressemble trop</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She drew the ermine over her pretty chin,
the diamonds sparkled in her hair; the bouquet
of gardenias swung in her hand. The eyes
of Geraldine grew very sombre and covetous.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am sorry I am a blot on the scene,&rsquo; he
said, moodily. &lsquo;Englishmen are always unpicturesque.
I stood still and gazed at you
all night, but no doubt I only looked like
a policeman or a fool&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Or both,&rsquo; she murmured, with a smile.</p>

<p>He continued unheedingly, &lsquo;While your
friend Othmar, who did precisely the same
thing, looked, of course, to you and to everybody,
like a Titian resuscitated.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Othmar is not especially like any Titian
that I have ever seen,&rsquo; said Madame Napraxine,
&lsquo;but he knows how to stand with grace, which
no Englishman ever did know yet. You are
quite right; your people do not &ldquo;compose&rdquo;
well, except when they are in the hunting-field,
or playing some very rough game; but you
need not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souffler</i> for compliments; you are
very good-looking&mdash;in your way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thanks,&rsquo; muttered Geraldine, in a tone
which would have better suited an imprecation.</p>

<p>Othmar had not danced once with her; he
had indeed only moved reluctantly through
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contre-danse</i> with his hostess; but the unerring
instinct of jealousy made the envy of
Geraldine fasten on him rather than on any
other of the crowd for whom the ball at Millo
had only meant Princess Napraxine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is a little chilly,&rsquo; said the Princess as
she turned from the open door.</p>

<p>Geraldine caught her hand which held the
fan: &lsquo;If you would but believe all that your
life is to us, you would not run such mad
risks as this raw cold fog after a ball! Had I
been Platon, I would have carried you to your
room by main force.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>The face of Nadine Napraxine grew very
cold.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are not Prince Napraxine&mdash;happily
for myself and yourself; and I do not like
impertinences. Go and smoke, and recover
your good manners.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You were kinder to me before Othmar
came home!&rsquo; said Geraldine, with injudicious
reproach.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have <em>very</em> bad manners,&rsquo; said the
Princess calmly, as she gathered up her ermine
and drew her flower-laden train over the little
hall and up the staircase.</p>

<p>She smiled as she passed upward.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How babyish they all are!&rsquo; she reflected.
&lsquo;As if to complain of another man were not
the very way to cement a woman&rsquo;s preference
for him,&mdash;if she had any preference. That
poor boy has no tact; if his sister had not said
anything about him I would send him away;
he is a bore. To be sure, he is here to take
Platon off one&rsquo;s hands, and smoke with him.
All men are tiresome when you have known
them a month or so; all human beings are
tiresome. Nobody ever tires of me, and I tire
of everybody. Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>She remembered that Othmar had alone
never tired her; he had been too romantic, too
presuming, too prone to fancy he had rights
and wrongs; but he had never wearied her.
Most men were so absurd when they were
enamoured of her, but he was not so; a little
too, like Ruy Blas perhaps a little too inclined
to be serious and impassioned, to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vieux
jeu</i> in a word; but still he had kept his grace
and kept his dignity. He kept them still; he
would not let her play with him. She was the
one woman on earth for him; but he did not
become her slave.</p>

<p>She had her bath and wrapped herself in a
loose gown of satin and lace and went out into
the garden with a rose-coloured hood over her
head. It was certainly cold, and the mists had
not altogether cleared; but it was a point of
honour with her to do what her physician and
her friends denounced as most dangerous.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Platon is snoring,&rsquo; she thought contemptuously,
as she glanced over the closed shutters.
&lsquo;And I dare say Geraldine snores too, if one
only knew. I dare say they both took soda and
brandy. Men are certainly unlovely creatures.
As long as we are young we are a little better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
than they; we look pretty asleep, and we don&rsquo;t
snore. How <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maquillée</i> poor Cri-Cri was last
night, and then she really throws her heart
into the affair with de Prangins; nothing ever
ages a woman like that; and I am quite sure
he does not care a straw about her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She walked up and down her terrace,
trailing her rose-coloured skirts over the
marble; she was a little sleepy, a little bored;
but she wished to show to her friends that she
could dance all night and breakfast out of
doors without more fatigue than a nightingale,
after singing all night, feels as he trips
across the grass at sunrise.</p>

<p>She thought, with a little amusement, that,
if Geraldine were really as wasting with despair
as he professed to be, he would have been out
of bed still on the mere chance of her reappearance.
The various degrees of passions in her
lovers diverted her; she had no vanity; she
could dissect and weigh their emotions with
perfect accuracy and philosophise upon them
with a clearness of understanding wholly beyond
the reach of vain woman. Analysis diverted
her much more than conquest. Some had loved
her tragically, some had died through her if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
not for her; she had had genuine triumphs,
great enough and costly enough to satisfy the
pride of anyone; therefore she could amuse
herself very well with the contradiction when
somebody, who declared that he only lived for
her, nevertheless drank his claret with relish;
or somebody else, who was for ever at her feet,
nevertheless ceased not to be critical of his
cigars.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor Othmar!&rsquo; she thought now; &lsquo;he
would stay sleepless in the street all night on
the chance of seeing my shadow on a window
blind!&rsquo;</p>

<p>That was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vieux jeu</i>; romanticism which
did not suit their world; which even made her
impatient of it as indifferent people are always
impatient of earnestness. But it was fine after
all: finer than Geraldine&rsquo;s sulkiness which let
him go to sleep.</p>

<p>The air was very cold, but the morning
was fair, and the mists were lifting higher and
higher every moment; as her skirts brushed
the bay hedge it gave forth a sweet odour,
snowdrops and hepatica blossomed under the
big aloes, and ground ivy was green about the
stems of the palms; the mountains grew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
hue of summer roses under the sun&rsquo;s approach,
then paled into amethyst and pearly grey; it
was intensely quiet, there was no sound but of
some unseen gardener sweeping up dead leaves;
the yellow wings of an oriole flashed among the
glossy leaves of a pitosperum.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The world looks as if God washed it clean
every morning,&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;It gets soiled
before noon. Decidedly it is only the birds
who are innocent enough for the sunrise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The latent sadness of the Russian character
was in her, beneath her <em>insouciance</em> and her
pessimism and her irony: sometimes she wished
she had not been born to that world in
which she lived, where there is no pause for
reflection, but only a continuous succession of
spectacles, excitations, revelries, where no one
is ever alone, where no one has ever time to
note a wild flower grow or a sun sink to the
west, where the babble of society is for ever
on the ear, and Nature has no place at all
except as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">décor de théâtre</i> of which no one
thinks more than the actor thinks of the painted
canvas behind him with its bridge or its garden
or its windmill.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do believe I should have liked to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
been a poor woman and have married such a
man as Millet or Corot,&rsquo; she thought to herself
now as she walked along the alley of bay that
ran parallel with the sea. Then she laughed
at the idea of herself, living in a cottage in a
French wood, without any lace, without any
diamonds, without any toilettes, looking for a
dusty footsore artist coming home through the
trees to his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pot au feu</i>. Somehow the artist
in her fancy had the features of Othmar,&mdash;of
Othmar, who was a prince of the Bourses and
could no more escape the world than she could!</p>

<p>It scarcely surprised her when she saw him
in person, as though her thoughts had compelled
him to come thither. He was alone,
in a little boat, which drifted slowly past the
sea-terrace of La Jacquemerille; his hands
rested idly on the oars, and his eyes were looking
upward at the house.</p>

<p>She leaned down through one of the openings
of the wall of clipt bay, and thrust her rose
satin hood over the water:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is it you, Othmar?&rsquo; she said to him.
&lsquo;What are you doing on the sea at eight
o&rsquo;clock? How astonished you look! Do you
wonder what I am doing in the open air?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
They are all asleep comfortably, though they
think I am courting death. Row to the stairs;
you can breakfast with me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He hesitated, looking up at her with his
head uncovered and his eyes dazzled by the
delicate face that was peering forth from the
framework of close-sheared bay boughs.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come!&rsquo; said Madame Napraxine. Her
voice could be very imperious, and was so
now.</p>

<p>He obeyed in silence, passed to the landing-place
a hundred yards farther down, and in
five minutes&rsquo; time approached her under the
arched roof of the bay charmille.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you were only back from the ball an
hour or less!&rsquo; he said, as he bowed before
her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was not inclined to go to bed; the
morning is fine. You are up betimes, too.
When did you leave Millo?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I left when you did,&rsquo; said Othmar, with
significance in the brevity of the reply.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then you cannot have breakfasted either.
You will breakfast with me; I was just going
back to the house.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was precisely the sort of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de scène</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
which would amuse her; her husband and
Geraldine lounging downstairs, late, cross, and
easily ruffled, to find her alone with their
neighbour from S. Pharamond. It was one
of those amusing little incidents which Providence,
who, she was sure, was kind to her, was
always sending her to relieve the monotony
of human life.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What were you doing under the sea wall?&rsquo;
she pursued. &lsquo;Is it your habit, too, never to
go to bed? You must have been rowing some
time. We are two sea leagues at least from
your place. What did you think of Cri-Cri&rsquo;s
ball? That new figure with the coloured hoops
was pretty; but the Duc leads a cotillon better
than anyone.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Admirable pre-eminence!&rsquo; said Othmar.
&lsquo;I saw you with the coloured hoops. You made
them look as if Ariel had just brought them
from Titania. But I do not think the charm
was in the hoops themselves.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you had cared to lead a cotillon, Othmar,
you might have been a happier man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That I do not doubt; the frivolous faculty
is a very happy one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;At all events, though you despise it, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
are indulgent to it. You gave us superb
presents at your own fête. Come in to breakfast.
I would not admit it if Platon were here,
but it <em>is</em> cold.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And surely it is not very wise to be in the
cold after a ball?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is what they all said, so I came. I
have not much sympathy with children, but
I do understand why they like to do a thing
for no other reason than that they are told not
to do it. My physicians pretend that morning
air is as bad as damp shoes, but I believe they
say that to be agreeable to their patients who
turn night into day. It is not only Molière&rsquo;s
doctors who are charlatans. I imagine it is the
perpetual affectation of sympathy which doctors
are compelled to put on which makes them
hypocrites. Come into the house.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He went on in silence beside her along the
bay path. He could not easily talk of trifles
with her; she had filled all his life for two
whole years; he loved her as he had loved no
other woman. When he had returned home
from the Millo ball, he had bathed and swam
in the little bay of S. Pharamond, and then had
rowed himself along the coast in that vague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
irresistible desire to pass near where she
dwelt which every true lover feels.</p>

<p>He had resolved to emancipate himself from
her power; as he had watched her through the
night he had told himself that to care for her
was to waste life on a baseless and ungrateful
dream. Yet, when she had looked down from
her evergreen rampart, and had said &lsquo;Come,&rsquo;
he had been unable to resist.</p>

<p>As he paced beside her now, the delicate
perfume of her laces, the floating, indefinite
lines of the rose-satin draperies, the glimpse of
her profile which the hood showed, her slender
feet in their rose-coloured pearl-sewn slippers,
which stepped so lightly over the shining
shingle of the paths&mdash;one and all they conquered
his calmness and his resolves, as the
fumes of new wine mount over the brain and
move the senses. She walked on, provocative
as Venus, unattainable as Una, speaking idly of
this thing and of that, knowing very well what
made his answers all at random and his colour
changeful. Other women might need to use
all the arts of conquest; might need to woo
with their eyes, to charm with their smiles, to
solicit with their glances. She had no such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
vulgar fashions; she moved, spoke, looked, as
the moment actuated her, and noticed her
lovers hardly more than she noticed the little
dog that ran after her skirts. To exist and
to be seen was enough to secure her more
victories than she chose to count.</p>

<p>If she noticed Othmar more than others it
was because he had gone away from her, he
had rebuked her, he had appeared to defy her,
and he had dared to tell her he loved her with
more reproach, and more bitterness of soul than
any other had ever done. She did not intend
to accept his life, or to give him hers; but she
did intend that his should be unable to detach
itself. And all the while she talked to him
with that easy, even kindness, as of a friend,
with those light philosophies of a woman of
the world, which were to the passions of a
man as ether spray thrown upon a lava-flood;
and she took him into breakfast with her as
though he were her brother.</p>

<p>She occasionally drank her chocolate in a
boudoir opening on to the terrace; a little nest
of white satin and looking-glass and Saxe china;
the ceiling was a mirror painted with little doves
and flowers; the carpet was of lambskins;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
the corners were filled with azaleas, rose and
white, like her gown. She looked only a larger
flower as she sank down on one of the couches.
The chocolate was served on Moorish trays, in
Turkish cups, by a little negro who, gorgeous in
his dress and immovable as a statue, was often
taken by new comers for an enamelled bronze
cast by Barbédienne, so motionless did he
squat before the door of any room she occupied.
Othmar almost envied that little
African menial the right he had to see his mistress
pass and repass a hundred times a day.
Nadine, in her nonchalant way, was kind to
the boy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He will die of pneumonia,&mdash;they always
do,&rsquo; she said now. &lsquo;Poor dusky little beetles,
they only live by their hot sand and their hot
sun; to be sure, our houses inside are as hot as
Africa, but outside, the east wind blows, and
one day it will blow too much for Mahmoud.
I suppose it would be a terrible thing for
civilisation if the East ever again surged over
the West; but the East has very much to
avenge, and I am not sure that civilisation
would be any great loss. It has discovered
that man is only a sort of hotbed for bacteria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
and that butter can be made out of river mud,
and coffee out of powdered tan.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She had taken the hood off her head; she
was as charming as a child freshly out of a
bath, with her eyes brilliant and her cheeks a
little warmed by the transition from the chill
air of early morning to the room heated to 30°
Réaumur. She had tossed herself backwards
amongst the white satin cushions. Her eyes,
which were like onyx, dwelt on him with a
gleam of amusement; her beautiful mouth had
the smile which was so enigmatical, so gay,
and yet so cold. She had had a different
smile when she had said to little Mahmoud,
&lsquo;Cover yourself warmly here; though the sun
shines, it is not African.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What has that black brat done that you
are so merciful to him?&rsquo; asked Othmar.</p>

<p>She replied: &lsquo;That black brat is a victim
of civilisation. I hate civilisation, as you
know. It even adulterates truffles.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did you ever smile so kindly on your own
children?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I cannot say. I do not count my smiles.
That poor little slave is interesting, he is an exile,
and he will die in a year or two; my children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
are insufferably uninteresting; they have unchangeable
health, intense stupidity, and will
grow up to have every desire fulfilled, every
caprice gratified, and to become that irresponsible,
useless, tyrannical, anachronism&mdash;a
Russian noble. Perhaps they will be good
soldiers and kill a score of Asiatics. Perhaps
they will only drink brandy, and gamble.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar did not reply; he was looking at
the exquisite grace of her form, the tea-rose
tint of her cheeks. Was it possible that she
could be the mother of two stout, ugly, Tartar-faced
boys? It seemed to him a profanation; a
hideous incongruity. He did not like to think
of it. If she had had a child at all it should
have been some blossom-like creature, sharing
her own grace as the catkin shares the
willow&rsquo;s. The subtlest charm about her was
that ethereality, as of a virginal goddess, which
was blent in her with all the <em>finesses</em> of seduction
and of mind. The boldest man felt
that in Nadine Napraxine the senses had hardly
more empire than in the ivory Venus of
the Greeks.</p>

<p>The eyes of Othmar dwelt on her now
yearningly, sombrely, wistfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;It is of no use,&rsquo; he said, abruptly. &lsquo;I did
wrong to come here. If you wish for men
who can, whilst they adore you, sit and drink
chocolate and talk epigrams, seek elsewhere;
I am not one of them. I can wear a mask,
but it must be of iron, not of velvet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The iron mask was of velvet,&rsquo; said she,
correcting him, unmoved by the repressed
passion in his voice. &lsquo;All our illusions vanish
under the electric light of history, and the iron
mask is one of them. I daily expect to hear
that Marie Antoinette was never guillotined,
but succumbed at seventy to dropsy at Schönbrunn;
we know it is proved that Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc
married and died, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne bourgeoise</i>, at Orleans,
and her family enjoyed a pension for three
generations from the town. It is very distressing,
but it is all proved from the archives.
Why shouldn&rsquo;t you drink chocolate? Perhaps
you do not like it. Men like nothing that has
sugar in it, except flattery. Ring. They will
bring you anything else.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar looked at her without speaking.
Something of the impotent rage against her
with which he had left her in Paris awoke in
him under the sting of her ever dulcet tones, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
which a little tone of mockery could be felt
rather than heard.</p>

<p>He rose abruptly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Have you never loved anyone?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She lifted her eyebrows with impatience
and astonishment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous voila emballé!</i> Dear Othmar, I
should like you so much if you would not
always revert to that old theme. You are
a man of the world, or you ought to be one.
Be amusing, even be instructive if you like; I
do not mind being instructed, but do not be
romantic. Nobody is nowadays; not even the
novelists.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar appeared scarcely to hear her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did you never love anyone?&rsquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>She laughed a little.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You speak as if I were forty years old,
with a cabinet full of old letters and faded
roses! No; I never loved anybody, not even
Platon!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The notion suggested in her last words
tickled her fancy so much that she laughed
outright.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;somewhere in
the world there are women who have loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Platon; but it seems too funny. He is always
eating when he is not drinking; he is always
smoking when he is not sleeping; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">admettons,
donc</i>, that Cupid must fly from his presence.
How grave you look. I believe you have
something of the Eastern in you, and think that
all women should be prostrate before their
husbands. There is a good deal of that idea
among the moujiks; it must be very agreeable&mdash;for
the man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why did you marry him?&rsquo; said Othmar,
gloomily; it hurt his sense of honour to speak
of Napraxine in Napraxine&rsquo;s house; yet he
could not repress the question.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, my friend, why do girls always
marry?&rsquo; she said, indifferently. &lsquo;Because
the marriage is there; because the families
have arranged it; because one does not
know; because one wishes for freedom, for
jewels, for the world; because one does not
care to be a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fillette</i>, chaperoned at every
step. There are many reasons that make one
marry: it is the thing to do&mdash;everyone does it;
when a girl sees the young married women,
she sees them flirted with, sought, monopolising
everything; it is like standing behind a shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
door and hearing people laughing and singing
on the other side, while you cannot get to
them; besides, Platon did as well as anybody
else, he is more good-natured than most; he
never interferes; he is very peaceable&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How long ago is it? Five years&mdash;six?
Why could I not meet you before?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She smiled, not displeased.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is seven years. Oh, I do not think it
would have done at all; you are too arrogant;
we should have quarrelled before a month was
out. Besides, I should have tormented you
to do all manner of impossibilities; with your
immense power, I should have expected you to
buy me an empire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar was very pale; the possibility of
which she jested so airily was one he could
not think of without a mist before his eyes,
a quickening of his heart. He hesitated to
say what rose to his lips; she would only call
it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vieux jeu</i>.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think you might be a great man,
Othmar, if you were not Othmar,&rsquo; she pursued.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not feel the capabilities,&rsquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is because you are what you are,&rsquo; she
answered. &lsquo;You are something like a king of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
England. A king of England might have
all the talents, but he could never be a great
man because his position binds him hand and
foot, and makes a lay figure of him. You are not
a lay figure, but the very fact that you are Otho
Othmar prevents your being anything besides.
I think, if I were you, I should buy some great
sunshiny fantastic eastern kingdom, and reign
there; you might lead the life of a Haroum
Alraschid, and forget all about our stupid
Europe with its big dinners, its blundering
politics, its unreal religions, and its hideous
dress.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A charming dream&mdash;if you were with me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, no; you would not want me; you
would have two thousand slaves, each more
beautiful than the others.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All my life I shall want you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>He spoke under his breath. He was leaning
back in his chair; his face was cold, almost
stern, but his eyes were ardent and full of
passion. All night at Millo he had sworn to
himself that never again would he succumb
to her influence or allow her to triumph in
the power she possessed over him, but in her
presence he was unnerved, and unable to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
silent. She, lying back amongst her cushions,
glanced at him under her long lashes, and
understood very well the strife which went on
in his soul; the pride of manhood which combatted
the impulses of passion; the impetus
which could not be resisted, the impatience of
his own weakness which vibrated through his
confession.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What was the use of your going to Mongolia;
you could not escape <em>me</em>,&rsquo; she thought,
with a little of that contemptuous indulgence
which she always felt for her lovers&rsquo; follies,
and a little of a newer and more personal gratification;
for Othmar touched a certain chord in
her mind, a certain pulse in her heart, which
others had not done. There was nothing
commonplace or trivial in him. There was a
vague power, unused but existent, which commanded
her respect. Nadine Napraxine despised
the world too heartily herself not to
have sympathy with the indifference he felt for
his own potentialities and possessions. He was
one of the masters of the world, and he only
wished for one thing on earth&mdash;herself. There
was a flattery in that which pleased even her,
sated with compliment though she was. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
were moments when she thought that if she
had met him before, as he said, there would
have been less ennui and more warmth in her
life. &lsquo;Only we should have been so sure to
have tired of each other,&rsquo; she reflected. &lsquo;People
always do; it is the fault of marriage; it
compels people at the onset to see so much of
one another that they have nothing new left
with which to meet the future. If you heard
the best of Bach every day, you would get
to hate Bach as intensely as you hate a street
organ; the music would still be perfect, but
it could not withstand incessant repetition.
We should have been quite idylically in love
for a few months; I am sure we should;
but then we should have each gone our several
ways, and in the end he would have been
hardly better than Platon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Aloud, however, she only said, with a little
smile:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You should never say things straight out
like that, Othmar. You should never go beyond
a suggestion. The world has spoilt you
so greatly that it has let you get blunt. It is
a pity. When I talk to people I always feel as
Boucher said he felt when he talked with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
lady-love. &ldquo;J&rsquo;aime tout ce qu&rsquo;elle va dire; je
n&rsquo;aime rien qu&rsquo;elle dit.&rdquo; If we could only
always remain at the stage when we are just
going to speak!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar did not reply. His face was very
pale; it had a set stern look, as though he
exercised great self-repression. He was angered
against himself for being there; for having let
her lead him thither merely to be made the
sport of her subtle and sarcastic intelligence. It
seemed to him that if his passion were unwelcome
to her his presence should be unwelcome
too.</p>

<p>She guessed his thoughts with that rapid
intuition which is the gift of such minds as
hers.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, I am not like that,&rsquo; she said, with some
unspoken amusement; &lsquo;I am not startled at a
confession like yours, as a horse starts at a pistol
shot. It seems to me that men are never
happy unless they are talking in that kind of
way to some woman who does not belong to
them. They are so like children! In Petersburg,
last year, I saw Sachs crying for a sentinel&rsquo;s
cartouche-box because he could not
have it. He had all Giroux&rsquo;s shop in his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
nursery, but that did not do. You are like
Sachs. Ought I to ring the bell and dismiss
you? Why should I? I do not think so.
Only very primitive beings take fright at
declarations. Besides, you made me so many
in Paris, and then you went to the Mongols.
I never knew why you went to the Mongols;
why did you go?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wounded brutes always get away somewhere
to be unseen as long as their wound
bleeds,&rsquo; said Othmar, with some bitterness.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How Sachs cried for that cartouche-box!&rsquo;
she said, as she lit a cigarette. &lsquo;His women
scolded him, but I said to them, &ldquo;Why do you
scold him? He is a male creature; therefore
he must weep for what he cannot get.&rdquo; Some
children cry for the moon; a moon, or a cartouche-box,
or a woman, the principle is the
same.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar rose and approached her. He
seemed scarcely to have heard her jest.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nadége, hear me a moment,&rsquo; he said, in a
low tone, through whose enforced calmness there
was the thrill of an intense passion. &lsquo;You are
not alarmed at declarations; they are nothing
to you, you neither requite nor reject them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
they amuse you, that is all. You are used to
do just what you please with men; I understand
that you despise them so far as you deign
to think of them seriously.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Despise, no!&rsquo; she said, with a little gesture
of depreciation; &lsquo;that is too strong. Why
should I despise them for acting according to
their natures? I do not desire cartouche-boxes
myself, but I did not despise Sachs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I told you in Paris,&rsquo; pursued Othmar,
&lsquo;that I would not add one to the list of those
whom you have made ridiculous in the eyes of
the world. I will be all to a woman, or
nothing to her. You would have let me swell
the cortège that marks your triumphal passage;
you would have let me fill the place that Lord
Geraldine occupies now. You would have
allowed me to drive with you, dine with you,
come in and out of your house, take your husband
away when he bored you, do everything
that Lord Geraldine is permitted to do now;
and you would have repaid me as you repay
him, by a little laugh, a smile now and then, a
vague liking which would have grown, little by
little, into contempt! I would not accept that
place in your household. I would not then.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
I left you, though it cost me more than you
would ever know or pity, for you do not
understand what love is. I went away; I desired
to escape from you. I did escape. I
desired also to forget you, but I could not
forget. You are not a woman who can be forgotten;
you are like one of those <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">miséricordes</i>
with which they stabbed men in the Valois
days, that look like mere threads of silver
sheathed in velvet, and yet can go home
through breast and bone, and kill more surely
than swords that are as high as a man&rsquo;s
shoulder&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>He paused a moment; he breathed quickly
and heavily; she looked up, holding her little
cigarette suspended:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am like a great many things,&rsquo; she murmured;
&lsquo;I thought Wilkes exhausted all possibilities
in comparison this morning. Go on!
you are very <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entreprenant</i>, but it rather becomes
you; you may go on if you like.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He dropped on his knee beside her:</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, I would not be what Geraldine is;
you tolerate him now, to scorn him immeasurably
hereafter. His own weakness will be the
measure of your scorn. He has never dared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
say to you what I said to you in Paris, what I
say now: love me, or I will not see your face
again, except as society may compel me to see
it in a crowd. Listen, Nadine! I love you,
only you; I never thought to love any woman
so; but I love you as men did in the old
times, and there is nothing I will not surrender
to you save my own self-respect. If to meet
you, to touch your hand, to hear your voice,
I must come and go like a dog in your husband&rsquo;s
house, petted one day, chidden the next,
absurd in my own sight and emasculated in the
sight of others, I will wrench my love for you
out of my life if my life goes with it! Last
night I heard someone who did not know him
inquire who Geraldine was; someone else answered
him, "Oh, that is one of Princess
Napraxine&rsquo;s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ensorcelés</i>; she never looks at him,
but he is content to follow her shadow." You
know me very little if you believe I would
ever let the world speak of me like that. I
told you in Paris I would never be the trembling
valet of a bloodless Platonism!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him, and a gleam of admiration
passed into her eyes for a moment; she
breathed a trifle more quickly; she thought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
herself: &lsquo;He is superb when he looks and
speaks like that! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C&rsquo;est un homme celui-là!</i>&rsquo;</p>

<p>She did not speak, she leaned back amongst
her cushions with a little look of expectancy
upon her face; the whole thing pleased her, as
some admirable piece of acting on the boards
of the Théâtre Français pleased at once her
eye, her ear, and her taste.</p>

<p>But Othmar was passionately in earnest;
all his heart was in his lips, all his passions
had found voice. He could scarcely see her
for the red mist that swam before his eyes,
for the tumult of his senses. He dropped on
his knee beside her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nadine,&rsquo; he murmured, as his forehead
touched her hand, &lsquo;I have told you what I
will not do; let me tell you what I will do. I
will do as you say, I will buy some sunlit
kingdom far away in the heart of Asia, and I
will take you to it and obey every breath of
your mouth as my one divine law. I will turn
my back on Europe once and for ever; I will
let men call me a coward, a fool, an infidel;
what they will; I will give all my present and
all my future to you and to you alone; all I
possess shall only exist to minister to you; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
will be your slave, body and mind and will;
but only <em>so</em>&mdash;only if you give yourself to me as
absolutely in return, only if you come with me
where nothing of this world which we have
known shall pursue us to remind me that you
were ever else than mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>His forehead burned her hand as it touched
her, his voice was passionate in its emotion and
eloquence, his heart beat so loudly that it was
audible in the stillness around them. For once
she was touched, almost awed; for once the
electricity of the passion she excited communicated
something of its fire and thrill to her.
She was silent a few moments, her eyelids
closed, her lips parted, she felt a vague
pleasure in the contact of this intense and
imperious love. He saw upon her delicate
features a change of colour, a flicker of emotion,
which no one else had ever seen there; but
she motioned him farther away from her with
that dislike to any concession and that sensitive
hauteur which but added to her charm.</p>

<p>She smiled a little, but there was an accent
which was almost tenderness in her voice as
she said to him: &lsquo;C&rsquo;est de ne rien perdre de
beaucoup prier! You evidently have belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
in that saying. It is to ask a very great deal,
but then you would give a great deal in your
turn. Go away now; I will think. No, I
shall not answer you; I want time for thought.
Be satisfied that I am not offended, and go.
I ought to be so, I suppose, but I am not.
Go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I may come back?&rsquo;</p>

<p>His heart beat eagerly and exultantly. He
was not refused or dismissed! &lsquo;Château qui
parle, femme qui écoutee&rsquo;&mdash;the old proverb
drifted through his thoughts, all confused as
they were in a tumult of hope and desire, and
triumph and doubt. A moment&rsquo;s hesitation
from her was more concession than a thousand
caresses from a humbler woman.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I may come back?&rsquo; he repeated, as she
remained silent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you like, we shall meet in other places;
yes, you may return in a fortnight&mdash;at this
time&mdash;in this room, then I will tell you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;In a fortnight!&rsquo;&mdash;it seemed to him to be
ten years.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Be thankful for so much,&rsquo; she said, as she
gave him the tips of her fingers. &lsquo;Now go.
Mahmoud is in the antechamber.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>He kissed her hand with lips that burned
like fire, bowed low and obeyed her. Nadine
Napraxine remained motionless, her eyes were
closed, her mouth smiled; she seemed to
dream.</p>
